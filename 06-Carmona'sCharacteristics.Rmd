# Carmona's Characteristics

Further analysis of people-generated spaces are looked through characteristics that have been modified from Carmonaâ€™s Public Space Design (2019) and Peterman's establishment of community spaces (2000). The characteristics help to serve as themes of discussion on what the forms that people-generated spaces undertake and in turn, what would need to be further understood. The characteristics are as follows: _diversity_, _free_, _delineated_, _balance accessibility_, _comfort_, _adequacy of seating_.

Diversity focuses on the level of heterogeneity within the people-generated spaces. This can be derived from two main observations; the types of spatial elements present in the space and the presence of state-provided elements.
