AK-G-08,Simple,People-generated,Garden,Yes,Not demarcated,Clean,None,0,None,None,1.3668018,103.8567615,"Outdoor garden that is built outside a first-floor resident's house. It is most likely set up the nearest residents, due to how the layout reflects its proximity to the entrance to the resident's main door. Demarcated only by the planting layout, although one section is fenced up and locked due to the value of bonsai plants. There is however, no seating provided within the space. Surveillance is also provided by the police, which probably indicates some history of theft and allowance by civic services for such a space.
