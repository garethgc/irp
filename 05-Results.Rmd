# Findings

This section focuses on the overall look at how people-generated spaces are found within the three neighbourhoods as well as the possible forms they take and the functions of the space which are expanded. 

Cataloging of the spaces required characteristics that could bind the different forms of people-generated spaces into logical groups. Since diversity of these spaces would result in difficulties in grouping such spaces, the research focuses instead on the degree of spatial interventions made by residents to these spaces.. Two logical groups are hence formed, being _simple_ and _advanced_. 

The **simple** group looks at the contributions of users within the space which increased the capabilities of the space but does not modify the functions of what the space was intended to be. For example, the addition of chairs and generic tables increase the capacity of a void deck seating area but does not add a new activity or function of the seating space. 

Spaces within the **advanced** group have interventions that modifies the functions of the provided space according to the needs to the users. For example, the provision of fridges and pantries to a void deck space no longer just provides a simple seating space, but also provides more elements of 'stay' with food and beverage consumption.

```

```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
PGS<-read_csv(here::here('/irpdata/PeopleGeneratedspacesv2.csv'))

PGS_nongardens<-filter(PGS,`Type of Space`=="Outdoor"|`Type of Space`=="Void Deck")

PGS_nongardens<-PGS_nongardens %>% 
  select(-URL)

PGS_nongardens %>% 
  count(Group) %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Category of People-Generated Spaces", "Number")) %>% 
  column_spec(1:2, width = 1)
```

Of the 27 people-generated spaces that are discovered, 21 fall under the **simple** category while 6 fall under the **advanced** categories. Majority of these spaces are considered simple as they add simple items that do not modify the space much, which includes additional chairs and tables, and do not necessarily change the function of the space. AK-0-03 is an example of such a space. 

## Simple People-generated Spaces

```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.cap= "AK_V_06 - A small sitting area, currently packed up"}

```


```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Simple01<-PGS_nongardens %>% 
  filter(`Location ID`=="AK-V-06") %>% 
  select(Remarks)

kable(Simple01,col.names = "A seating area with a view") %>% 
  column_spec(1:1,width = 5,background = "#F6DDCC ")
```

The formation of **simple** people-generated spaces does not necessarily translate to a lack of seating capacity of the space, but it also could imply the orientation of the current seats do not fit the preferences of residents using the space. The spaces listed below show a capacity of seats provided that is deemed sufficient and not an extraordinary amount of additional furniture being added. However, they do have a nice viewing range of the surrounding area which the state-provided seats do not capture, and hance, in the context of activities such as people-watching, encourage people to instead provide their own seating preferences.

Some spaces do postulate a lack of provision by the state, though it is not necessarily a case of insufficiency but the nature of how the communities that create these spaces gather. An example would be AK_O_01, which is situated at the back of a coffeeshop. 

```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap= "AK_O_01 - A space behind a coffeeshop"}
include_graphics("/Users/garethconceicao/Desktop/Independent Research/irp/irp/irpdata/Amk People Generated/AK_O_01.jpg",dpi = 72)
```

```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Simple02<-PGS_nongardens %>% 
  filter(`Location ID`=="AK-O-01") %>% 
  select(Remarks)

kable(Simple02,col.names = "A quiet space behind a coffeeshop") %>% 
  column_spec(1:1,width = 5,background = "#F6DDCC ")
```

It is not common to have community spaces directly behind the kitchens of a coffeeshop due to the fumes and the lack of nice view. However, these areas serve a different form of community; the staff working at the shops. They may not be able to travel far to other community spaces amidst their breaks and if they would want to enjoy a certain peace, the rear of a coffeeshop where no one walks is a good place to set up a space. The visibility of the space allows the users a short getaway from the bustle in front of them, while keeping them close enough to react to any duties they need to attend. It is also worth noting that AK-O-01 has a mini garden that is probably tended to by the staff, as a community garden set up by the state can be found barely 10 metres away from this space. As community gardens often have exclusive access, this space tends to allow the staff, who would not be residents, to have a space of their own. There are other spaces that too follow such trends, being close to amenities but in locations where it would not be most favourable for development in theory.

## Advanced People-generated Spaces

```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, out.width = '75%', fig.show='asis',fig.align='center', fig.cap= "BD_O_06, an advanced people-generated space that creates a work and sitting area to cater to the nearby garden and fruit tree"}

```

The five **advanced** people-generated spaces found in the three neighbourhoods have increased the functions of the spaces of which they were originally designed. Extending beyond the provision of additional flexibility in sitting or people-watching activities as well as increasing load of the space, their modifications are reactive to the environment that they are set within. The people-generated space of **BD_O_06** is formed around a tree which has no prior state provided elements. The evolution of functions within the space can be seen with the potted garden that has grown within it, equipment storage that serve both stewardship of the garden and the tree as well as multiple chairs just for seating. Nearby HDB blocks house provision shops and a hardware store, and this space creates a sense of activity that is not unlike the amenities found in close proximity.

(Insert a map of surrounding vicinity and this space)

```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, out.width = '75%', fig.show='asis',fig.align='center', fig.cap= "AK_V_05, an advanced people-generated space that creates a living space at a void deck, full a range of electrical appliances for multiple conveniences"}
include_graphics("/Users/garethconceicao/Desktop/Independent Research/irp/irp/irpdata/Amk People Generated/AK_V_05.jpg",dpi = 72)
```


**AK_V_05** is an interesting relocated space. Initially, due to a construction hoarding nearby, it was not clear what this space entailed. Upon further investigation through Google Street View, the makeshift store was constructed to house the items from the ongoing renovation of the senior citizens corner. The layout of the relocated furniture, which have been provided by residents, resembles that of a gathering space, with lighting provided for reading as if it were in a normal HDB unit. While unique that it has electrical power sources due to the relocation, resident's choice of furniture and appliances in the open is an impression for the activities that take place in this space. A cross-trainer exercise machine can be found in the corner, with natural draft coming in from that direction. The heterogeneity of elements within this space speaks about the contributions of the residents into developing this living space or even the previous senior citizen corner; diverse yet focused on comfort to their preference. 


```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, out.width = '75%', fig.show='asis',fig.align='center', fig.cap= "HG_V_20, an advanced people-generated space that has a strong cultural and old school vibe with the types of furniture and ornaments present"}
include_graphics("/Users/garethconceicao/Desktop/Independent Research/irp/irp/irpdata/Hougang People Generated/HG_V_20.jpg",dpi = 72)
```

**HG_V_20** is a unique people-generated space found in a void deck near a bus stop. While there are not any prominent amenities nearby such as coffeeshops or provision shops, this space is rather developed and invested in by a community. In fact, the nearest coffeeshop is found across the main road which is a considerable distance away. With the mix of dated furniture such as stone bences and newer plastic types, this space pops out with its own personality. Compounding on the heterogeneity is the presence of religious ornaments, pictures and decorations of pre-dominantly Chinese origin. Religion has always been seen as a personal element and its existence here could impress upon a particular demographic that enjoys the space and has a connection that has been built over time. It is important to note that such elements may deter the idea of inclusivity, as not every resident will fall under the particular religion that is depicted here.
