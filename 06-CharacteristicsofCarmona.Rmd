# Carmona's Characteristics

Further analysis of people-generated spaces are looked through characteristics that have been modified from Carmonaâ€™s Public Space Design (2019) and Peterman's establishment of community spaces (2000). The characteristics help to serve as themes of discussion on what the forms that people-generated spaces undertake and in turn, what would need to be further understood. The characteristics are as follows: _diversity_, _free_, _delineated_, _balance accessibility_, _comfort_, _adequacy of seating_.

```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,fig.cap="List of simple people-generated spaces across the three neighbourhoods"}
PGS_nongardens %>%
  filter(Group=="Simple") %>% 
  select(-Remarks,-Category,-lat,-lon,-Group) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling("striped",font_size = 10)
```


```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap= "List of advanced people-generated spaces across the three neighbourhoods" }
PGS_nongardens %>%
  filter(Group=="Advanced") %>% 
  select(-Remarks,-Category,-lat,-lon,-Group) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling("striped",font_size = 10)
```


## Diversity

Diversity focuses on the level of heterogeneity within the people-generated spaces. This can be derived from two main observations; the types of spatial elements present in the space and the presence of state-provided elements. 

## Free


## Delineated

## Balance Accessibility

## Comfort

## Adequacy of Seating


### To be moved to Appendix later!
```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
PGS_obs<-PGS_nongardens %>% 
  select(`Location ID`,`Type of Space`,Remarks) 


PGS_obs %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling("striped",font_size = 10)

```

```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
PGS_obs %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Remarks,paste(c("walkway","pathway"),collapse='|')))
```


```{r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
PGS_obs %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(Remarks,paste(c("walkway","pathway"),collapse='|'))) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Remarks,"coffeeshop"))
```
