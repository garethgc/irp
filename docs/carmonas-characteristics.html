<h1><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Carmona’s Characteristics</h1>
<p>Further analysis of people-generated spaces are looked through characteristics that have been modified from Carmona’s Public Space Design (2019) and Peterman’s establishment of community spaces (2000). The characteristics help to serve as themes of discussion on what the forms that people-generated spaces undertake and in turn, what would need to be further understood. The characteristics are as follows: <em>diversity</em>, <em>free</em>, <em>delineated</em>, <em>balance accessibility</em>, <em>comfort</em>, <em>adequacy of seating</em>.</p>

An outdoor space found just behind a coffeeshop. Non-sheltered, users have set up chairs, placed behind the pots and plants. Clearly people-generated, there is no demarcation of the space. Looking at the proximity to the coffeeshop, it is more than likely setup by the staff of the coffeeshop rather than a larger community initiative. All the furniture are heterogeneous, and there is a possibility it is also used as a smoking corner, with visibility being minimal. There are no cameras by the state of the users in the space.

An outdoor space found adjacent to a coffeeshop and an outdoor carpark that is dominated by large vehicles. Multiple wooden benches are stacked haphazardly in the corner, an indication of times when these could be laid out for more informal gatherings, adding on to the existing chairs at the perimeter of the space. As they were not laid out, it is unsure how the layout is however, it could be a gathering space for truck or bus drivers to have a smoke before or after work. There are no cameras in this vicinity.

While it is under a state-provided shelter, it is considered to be an outdoor space. Additional chairs have been provided in this space, which is at the junction of a sheltered walkway and the path to the bus stop and pedestrian crossing. Also, a dustbin has been provided there. Whilst most likely not for smoking, due to the nature of it being plastic, it gives the impression of a place of ‘stay’. Two of the users of the space had gone to see a small community garden just a few metres away, with another fellow member tending to the garden. This could be a regular activity for them, since the seats do provide a vantage view of the garden and the crossings for people-watching. No cameras on site.

This void deck space is easily missable, due to the placement of pillars throughout the space and an awkward presence of state-provided benches that accompany each pillar. Stacked plastic chairs can be seen chained to one of these benches, where an elderly man sits. A folded table top is found in the corner of one of the pillars. Personal items can be seen on another stack of plastic chairs, where another resident uses at a nearby washing point. The layout is uncertain, since the chairs remained stacked, but the location is overlooking a nearby carpark, while also near the town centre. It seemed to have a decent traffic of non-users, as it is near a mailbox and a lift landing. There are no cameras overlooking the space.

A void deck seating area that is situated near the sheltered walkway between HDB blocks and the nearby bus stop. While there is state provision of the fixed red furniture and metal benches, additional seats can be found filling the gap along a wall. Also, a small drawer cabinet hosting plastic items can be seen here, with water bottles found nearby. While it is the purpose of the bottles is unclear, these items are not locked or secured. Yet, it seems to be relatively safe. A camera provided by the state is present but it seems unlikely to be provided as security for these items, rather since this space serves as an entrance to the sheltered paths. Interestingly, the adjacent void deck space has folded tables as well as a signage on a limit on the quantity of tables to be used. This could be indicative of state-support of this space.

This space is rather unique, in that it has a makeshift store found beside it. As there is no large construction project nearby, it is interesting to find a store that seems to be under the care of residents. This space is also without any state-provided furniture, essentially providing a new seating space in a void. Tables that look more as household dining tables rather than sitting tables and household wooden chairs make it heterogeneous. Stacks of plastics chairs can be found organized nicely against a wall. The presence of fridges and freezes allows the space to provide beverages or food. Along with fans and an exercise machine, it creates the impression of a living space in the void. It is populated by residents during the trips, both in late morning and late afternoon. There are no cameras in this space but the provision of power in a void deck (normally not possible) would indicate that the authorities know such a space exists.

This space in the void deck consists of additional seats, with wooden chairs being the primary aesthetic and stacked in the corner. It is a confluence of multiple covered walkways, linking an adjacent coffeeshop with a pedestrian crossing towards another coffeeshop. Hence, this space sees much traffic as well. While there are metal benches provided by the state, the orientation of furniture that are set up by residents faces the view of the pedestrian crossing, being a elevated position. It can be deduced this space is mostly used for people-watching. There was an elderly woman sitting in such a position. There are no cameras in this vicinity.

A table tennis table that was provided by the state, some wooden chairs have been added to the space. They are placed beneath the table, in a manner that creates an impression of hiding, which could postulate that they may not exactly be accepted. However, it is a simple layout, and it could indicate the table tennis either being highly used, with the chairs as waiting seats, or the table is being used for other activities than the sport.

People watching could be a prominent activity here, as it has a good vantage view of activities. A table with locked drawers can be found as well, which could indicate this space could encourage some form of handiwork. Other people-generated furniture can be seen haphazardly stored in a corner, with trolleys. The area is also decorated with various Chinese ornaments and decorations from the ceiling and walls, giving the impression that a Chinese-dominant demographic inhabits such a space.

A very small space, set up near the utility room of the HDB block. Importanly, it is not visible at most angles, which could probably facilitate its hidden nature and possibility, the lack of state knowledge. There are additional seating provided, along with a mirror and an ash tray. This gives the impression that this area is a resting space for workers that have to maintain these rooms, with shelter for hot and wet weather as well as the mirror for facial maintenance.

This space is adjacent to a lift landing that looks to have been developed during the lift upgrading programme (sticks out of the block). While wooden seating has been provided along the low wall, a sofa seat and additional wooden chairs have been provided in the immediate space. The camera serves the lift landing and hence, can see a portion of the space. The additional seats serve as a better arrangement especially should there be rainfall, since they are found in the deeper section of shelter as compared to the state-provided seats. Also, they have a vantage view of the surrounding vicinity, including the potted garden nearby and the canal just further down.

Similar to other spaces, they are arranged such that they are more sheltered against rain. Hidden from view is an religious altar that is placed behind the lift shaft extension, under a tree. Residents that provide these chairs most likely are contributors to the altar as well, along with the potted garden found in the space. Just as the other similar spaces, the camera can only see a certain portions of the seats, not the altar or edge plastic seats.

A sheltered open space found adjacent to a coffeeshop, furniture has been taken from the coffeeshop to be used as seating in a space that the state has already provided wall seats. In particular, this shelter also serves as a pathway from the sheltered walkways from adjacent blocks to the coffeeshop and the placement of the chairs further limit the walking space. Individuals were using this space as a resting area, although it remains to be seen if this is the primary usage due to current circumstances. There are no cameras in this space.

An outdoor space that is found adjacent to a coffeeshop. With multiple foldable tables and plastic chairs which are taken from the coffeeshop, it provides a separated space from the commercial outlet. With the presence of cabinets and a toy bicycle, it would probably be frequented by regulars of the coffeeshop as well, as it overlooks multiple pathways between blocks. Hence, people watching may be a prominent activity here. Also, smoking is allowed in this space, since it is outdoor, which would probably be facilitated by the fact that the coffeeshop does not have one. There are no cameras in this location.

Situated behind a lift landing, these space houses state-provided furniture, but with additional wooden chairs as well. These were layout rather disorganized, probably indicating that this is not the original layout of the space.

Along with its proximity to a coffeeshop and large vantage view of the surrounding HDB estate, it would be a space of relaxation.

A space that is sandwiched between a basketball court and a sheltered walkway, it is umbrella-ed by a large tree. It has been heavily modified, with no state-provided seats or gardens found in the area yet plastic chairs and potted plants can be found arranged nicely in the space. The equipment for the plants, as well as a makeshift toolrack that i suspended from the tree branch provides a mini-work area for the space, allowing the denizens of the space to work with organization. Locked cupboards and drawers are arranged nicely along the caged basketball court and it gives a sense of a well-contributed and cared for space. Also, as some of the equipment are modified gala poles with nets, this could be indicative there fruit picking is a possible activity in this space. Overall, this space creates a living space and is more advanced than other outdoor spaces. There are no cameras in the area.

A small tin container can be seen as an ash tray for smokers. Pails and other types of equipment can be seen behind the pillars to service the small plants that are developed towards the carpark at the back of the space, with Chinese decorations on them. This space does not have a camera but the provision of exercise equipment by the state, which looks rather new, to the space would indicate that this space is accepted and known to exist for the residents. Due to its connectivity, it is most likely used as a people-watching activity, since it elevated higher than the main road, and has a good vantage point.
