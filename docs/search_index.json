Figure 4.1: Figure 4.1: (Left, BD_O_01)Adjacent sitting area to a lift landing where a sofa seat and wooden chairs have been provided, overlooking a small garden patch. (Right, BD_O_02) Plastic chairs provided to a similar location as the left image, with a small religious altar and garden found just behind the lift landing Figure 4.2: Figure 4.2: (Left, BD_O_06) Stacked chairs with a makeshift storage area and hanging tools by the tree with a potted garden nearby creates an expansive and invested space by the residents (Right, BD_O_07) Foldable tables and chairs set up under a tree, with a resident enjoying his time. A sitting spot for potential betters at the Singapore Pools Figure 4.3: Figure 4.3: (Left, BD_O_03) Chairs are pulled away from the adjacent coffeeshop to a nearby shelter instead of using the wall benches. A shelter from the heat of the day but turning a large space into a significantly smaller one (Right, BD_O_04) Another spot adjacent to a coffeeshop seeing high traffic across paths to get to the coffeeshop. With cabinets, tables and chairs, it extends the interaction from the coffeeshop to a more smoke-friendly location Figure 4.4: Figure 4.4: (Left, BD_O_05) Rattan chairs are placed in a random manner, with a cooler box bicycle-locked to a bench. Possible drinking and smoking space due to the nearby coffeeshop and the skewness of the furniture towards outdoors. Figure 4.5: Figure 4.5: (Left, BD_V_03) Wooden and plastic chairs arranged nicely along the wall, for a much larger gathering than the intended 6-seater provided table. Chinese decorations hung around with a clock nearby, giving an impression of a space where people passed the time. (Right, BD_V_09) More seating provided through wooden and plastic chairs beside a minimart space, with rags and containers (unseen in the photo) ‘decorating’ the area. "]
