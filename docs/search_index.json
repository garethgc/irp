HDB has created spaces for communities to exist through designation of resident corners at void decks, creation of community centres and small-scale food establishments such as void deck ‘coffeeshops’. People-generated spaces have also existed, where residents have initiated their own spatial interventions. These interventions vary from additional furniture such as chairs and small coffee tables to build in cabinets and fridges, creating an environment of coziness that residents could enjoy. These people-generated spaces exhort a sense of community, with residents coming together and interacting in these spaces, along with their contributions to the space. Members who use these spaces may not necessarily be residents living in close proximity. As with community developed spaces, there is the possibility of the creation of community spaces and by extension, people-generated spaces, through a common interest (Jacobs ,1961). It is worth exploring the spatial patterns of people-generated spaces in relation to state-provided community spaces which could offer insights on the interests of residents in creating these spaces. Importantly, through the understanding of possible drivers of the creation of the people-generated spaces, this could highlight possible needs of residents with respect to community living that may be hidden from state designers and planners.

["overview.html", "2 Overview 2.1 3 Neighbourhoods", " 2 Overview 2.1 3 Neighbourhoods Neighborhoods that are shortlisted for study will be mature HDB estates, developed between the 1960s and the 1970s, as well as estates that hold a large population. Three neighborhoods, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok will be chosen for observation. They are chosen not only for their development period, but they also carry a large populace of 180,000 and above while having shared boundaries (City Population, n.d.). Maturity is an important element as it enables better understanding of the interactions and processes in the spaces which may have changed across time while a large living demography enables a better capture and representation for other neighborhoods. As the three mature neighborhoods are found in close proximity to each other, this allows for the study to observe possible spatial ‘spillovers’, whereby spatial distributions and trends are present between neighborhoods.

["hougang.html", "3 Hougang 3.1 Journey through Hougang", " 3 Hougang The first neighbourhood for fieldwork, it comprises of a traditionally Teochew Community in the North East. Where it was home to an agricultural lifestyle in the past, it housed relocated residents from those lands during the era of urban development of Singapore. Seen as one of the older estates, the HDB landscape has been retrofitted and upgraded over the years, including the community spaces both indoors and outdoors. A nuance of Hougang is that it has a reputation of being an Opposition stronghold in terms of politics in Singapore. Due to the nature of politics in Singapore, there has been an unproven impression that Hougang would lack the amenities of politically incumbent estates. Throughout the walks across the neighbourhood, starting from the HDB estates along the Serangoon river (north-east), various different forms of community spaces could be seen. Importantly, community gardens along the North East stretch of Hougang were found to be less exclusive in terms of security and accessibility. While community gardens are not indicated in the mapping of people-generated spaces, they pre-empt an impression of the forms of spaces that could be present in this neighbourhood. The sub sections below will narrate the routes taken across the neighbourhood of Hougang. In total, it took 6 separate days, due to limitations of accessibility and the physicality of not being able to rest. 3.1 Journey through Hougang The cataloging route started from the confluence of Upper Serangoon Road and Hougang Ave 7 towards the north-east side of Hougang. As these areas housed mostly older generation of HDB blocks, there were more instances of community gardens that were makeshift and people-generated (I would most likely highlight areas using separate colours). However, they were not devoid of upgrades, as the sheltered paths could be seen through the blocks and parks found in this vicinity. There were a mix of new HDB blocks, recently built during the past 5 years as well as condominiums. The route would eventually lead south, cutting across Tampines Road into Hougang Ave 1, Lorong Ah Soo and Defu. The blocks along Hougang St 22 were newer in contrast to the previous vicinity, and it showed more state-provided community spaces. People-generated spaces found here were mostly found along low HDB blocks with first floor units, often developing the front area of their homes with gardens and sitting areas. Whether these spaces were accessible to all, it is unknown. Closer to the Hainanese Food Market, there were more state-provided community spaces. Interestingly, additional elements have been added to these spaces, giving them a more personalised feel. There are seven people-generated spaces found within Hougang, specifically towards outdoor and void deck spaces.

["findings-and-discussion.html", "6 Findings and Discussion 6.1 Simple People-generated Spaces 6.2 Advanced People-generated Spaces", " 6 Findings and Discussion This section focuses on the overall look at how people-generated spaces are found within the three neighbourhoods as well as the possible forms they take and the functions of the space which are expanded. Cataloging of the spaces required characteristics that could bind the different forms of people-generated spaces into logical groups. Since diversity of these spaces would result in difficulties in grouping such spaces, the research focuses instead on the degree of spatial interventions made by residents to these spaces.. Two logical groups are hence formed, being simple and advanced. The simple group looks at the contributions of users within the space which increased the capabilities of the space but does not modify the functions of what the space was intended to be. For example, the addition of chairs and generic tables increase the capacity of a void deck seating area but does not add a new activity or function of the seating space. Spaces within the advanced group have interventions that modifies the functions of the provided space according to the needs to the users. For example, the provision of fridges and pantries to a void deck space no longer just provides a simple seating space, but also provides more elements of ‘stay’ with food and beverage consumption. Category of People-Generated Spaces Number Advanced 5 Simple 21 Of the 26 people-generated spaces that are discovered, 21 fall under the simple category while 5 fall under the advanced categories. Majority of these spaces are considered simple as they add simple items that do not modify the space much, which includes additional chairs and tables, and do not necessarily change the function of the space. AK-0-03 is an example of such a space. 6.1 Simple People-generated Spaces Figure 6.1: AK_V_06 - A small sitting area, currently packed up A seating area with a view This space in the void deck consists of additional seats, with wooden chairs being the primary aesthetic and stacked in the corner. It is a confluence of multiple covered walkways, linking an adjacent coffeeshop with a pedestrian crossing towards another coffeeshop. Hence, this space sees much traffic as well. While there are metal benches provided by the state, the orientation of furniture that are set up by residents faces the view of the pedestrian crossing, being a elevated position. It can be deduced this space is mostly used for people-watching. There was an elderly woman sitting in such a position. There are no cameras in this vicinity. The formation of simple people-generated spaces does not necessarily translate to a lack of seating capacity of the space, but it also could imply the orientation of the current seats do not fit the preferences of residents using the space. The spaces listed below show a capacity of seats provided that is deemed sufficient and not an extraordinary amount of additional furniture being added. However, they do have a nice viewing range of the surrounding area which the state-provided seats do not capture, and hance, in the context of activities such as people-watching, encourage people to instead provide their own seating preferences. HG_O_14 HG-V-24 BD_O_01 BD_O_02 BD_O_03 BD_O_05 BD_O_07 BD_O_09 AK_V_01 AK_V_02 AK_O_02 Some spaces do postulate a lack of provision by the state, though it is not necessarily a case of insufficiency but the nature of how the communities that create these spaces gather. An example would be AK_O_01, which is situated at the back of a coffeeshop. Figure 6.2: AK_O_01 - A space behind a coffeeshop A quiet space behind a coffeeshop An outdoor space found just behind a coffeeshop. Non-sheltered, users have set up chairs, placed behind the pots and plants. Clearly people-generated, there is no demarcation of the space. Looking at the proximity to the coffeeshop, it is more than likely setup by the staff of the coffeeshop rather than a larger community initiative. All the furniture are heterogeneous, and there is a possibility it is also used as a smoking corner, with visibility being minimal. There are no cameras by the state of the users in the space. It is not common to have community spaces directly behind the kitchens of a coffeeshop due to the fumes and the lack of nice view. However, these areas serve a different form of community; the staff working at the shops. They may not be able to travel far to other community spaces amidst their breaks and if they would want to enjoy a certain peace, the rear of a coffeeshop where no one walks is a good place to set up a space. The visibility of the space allows the users a short getaway from the bustle in front of them, while keeping them close enough to react to any duties they need to attend. It is also worth noting that AK-O-01 has a mini garden that is probably tended to by the staff, as a community garden set up by the state can be found barely 10 metres away from this space. As community gardens often have exclusive access, this space tends to allow the staff, who would not be residents, to have a space of their own. There are other spaces that too follow such trends, being close to amenities but in locations where it would not be most favourable for development in theory.

Extending beyond the provision of additional flexibility in sitting or people-watching activities as well as increasing load of the space, their modifications are reactive to the environment that they are set within. The people-generated space of BD_O_06 is formed around a tree which has no prior state provided elements. The evolution of functions within the space can be seen with the potted garden that has grown within it, equipment storage that serve both stewardship of the garden and the tree as well as multiple chairs just for seating. Nearby HDB blocks house provision shops and a hardware store, and this space creates a sense of activity that is not unlike the amenities found in close proximity. (Insert a map of surrounding vicinity and this space) Figure 6.7: AK_V_05, an advanced people-generated space that creates a living space at a void deck, full a range of electrical appliances for multiple conveniences AK_V_05 is an interesting relocated space. Initially, due to a construction hoarding nearby, it was not clear what this space entailed. Upon further investigation through Google Street View, the makeshift store was constructed to house the items from the ongoing renovation of the senior citizens corner. The layout of the relocated furniture, which have been provided by residents, resembles that of a gathering space, with lighting provided for reading as if it were in a normal HDB unit. While unique that it has electrical power sources, due to the relocation, resident’s choosing which furniture and appliances to leave in the open is an impression for the activities that take place in this space. A cross-trainer exercise machine can be found in the corner, with natural draft coming in from that direction. The heterogeneity of elements within this space speaks about the contributions of the residents into developing this living space or even the previous senior citizen corner; diverse yet centralised on comfort to their preference.
