HDB has created spaces for communities to exist through designation of resident corners at void decks, creation of community centres and small-scale food establishments such as void deck ‘coffeeshops’. In a country where most of the spaces and amenities have been designed through a central planning approach, community spaces in Singapore almost has a determinism design. Through the study of social interactions and behaviours, community spaces in Singapore have been curated in order to foster community development in HDB estates, albeit in the manner that is civically accepted by the state. In the midst of the state-provided spaces, people-generated spaces also exist, where residents have initiated their own spatial interventions. These interventions vary from additional furniture such as chairs and small coffee tables to build-in cabinets and fridges, creating an environment of cosiness that residents could enjoy. People-generated spaces exhort a sense of community, with residents coming together and interacting in these spaces, along with their contributions to the space. These spaces play a role in neighbourhood planning as it creates an avenue where the community develops spaces for its’ specific needs (Checkoway, 1984). Yet, people-generated spaces remain relatively unknown in the mainstream knowledge of spaces in HDB estates in Singapore. This paper seeks to highlight the forms that people-generated spaces undertake as well as the themes that inspire or are impressed through the development of spaces in the context of community spaces in Singapore. 1.1 People-generated Spaces People-generated spaces in Singapore are hardly well documented, be it through academic publications or mainstream journalism. It shares similarities to community participatory planning, which is an increasingly used manifesto in community space development in Singapore (URA, 2015; Nair, 2017). The development of the space is, by and large, by a community that shares an interest in the particular space and are not necessarily bound by geographic proximity (Jacobs, 1961). However, where it differs from community participatory planning is process of empowerment of the community into developing these spaces. Community participatory planning is often regarded as a collaboration between the state and community, with the former initiating the platform to empower the community to develop spaces. Be it during the conceptual stage or the feedback stage of the development of a project, the state essentially has empowered the community into making design decisions. Such projects often involve spaces that, as unique as they are intended to be, eventually serve a much larger demography than the community itself. Also, since it is state-driven, community participatory planning would still have to fall in line with urban planning technicalities such as amenity provision and accessibility requirements. People-generated spaces, on the other hand, is the innate empowerment of the community or residents to develop spaces of their own which fulfils the specific needs of that community. These spaces tend to border a line of accepted spatial interventions, whereby it does not cause concern for the overall community yet would probably only benefit those who have invested in it. Hence, people-generated spaces are more random and heterogeneous than projects that arise from community participatory planning. People-generated spaces tend to resonate closely to Jacob’s definition of ‘street neighbourhood communities’, where the development of the space is not bound led through political power and yet it is able to form social spaces (Jacobs, 1961). As with the seemingly rebellious nature of people-generated spaces, they are subject to state approval once discovered. Especially if these spaces cause more harm to the neighbourhood community, people-generated spaces may cease to exist. However, they present a form of community space and resident empowerment that showcases how an unplanned space can support and create living communities. The uniqueness of the spatial interventions in people-generated spaces also speaks about the identity of the community in the space, just as much as the murals painted by community planning groups in HDB estates. It is important to see these spaces beyond notions of competition with existing community spaces, but how their development explains about community spaces in Singapore. "],
["the-approach-to-exploring.html", "2 The approach to exploring 2.1 Forms and Narratives 2.2 Three Neighbourhoods", " 2 The approach to exploring 2.1 Forms and Narratives The exploration during this project identifies the forms that people-generated spaces can present themselves in, as well as the different narratives which can be found in the nuances of these spaces. Acknowledging the diversity of these spaces through the understanding of their self-initiation, would breathe more life into the topic of community space development that are found within in Singapore. These spaces could either challenge or support the existing approaches planning bodies have undertaken in order to create community spaces that enliven neighbourhoods. Underlying all these would also give a little insight on the possible motivations on why these spaces exist or how they could be possibly formed. 2.2 Three Neighbourhoods Neighborhoods that are shortlisted for study will be mature HDB estates, developed between the 1960s and the 1970s, as well as estates that hold a large population. Three neighborhoods, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok will be chosen for observation. They are chosen not only for their development period, but they carry a large populace of 180,000 and above while having shared boundaries (City Population, n.d.). Maturity is an important element as it enables better understanding of the interactions and processes in the spaces which may have changed across time while a large living demography enables a better capture and representation for other neighborhoods.

["hougang.html", "3 Hougang 3.1 Journey through Hougang 3.2 Images of the Spaces", " 3 Hougang The first neighbourhood for fieldwork, it comprises of a traditionally Teochew Community in the North East. Where it was home to an agricultural lifestyle in the past, it housed relocated residents from those lands during the era of urban development of Singapore. Seen as one of the older estates, the HDB landscape has been retrofitted and upgraded over the years, including the community spaces both indoors and outdoors. A nuance of Hougang is that it has a reputation of being an Opposition stronghold in terms of politics in Singapore. Due to the nature of politics in Singapore, there has been an unproven impression that Hougang would lack the amenities of politically incumbent estates. Throughout the walks across the neighbourhood, starting from the HDB estates along the Serangoon river (north-east), various different forms of community spaces could be seen. Importantly, community gardens along the North East stretch of Hougang were found to be less exclusive in terms of security and accessibility. While community gardens are not indicated in the mapping of people-generated spaces, they pre-empt an impression of the forms of spaces that could be present in this neighbourhood. The sub sections below will narrate the routes taken across the neighbourhood of Hougang. In total, it took 6 separate days, due to limitations of accessibility and the physicality of not being able to rest. 3.1 Journey through Hougang The cataloging route started from the confluence of Upper Serangoon Road and Hougang Ave 7 towards the north-east side of Hougang. As these areas housed mostly older generation of HDB blocks, there were more instances of community gardens that were makeshift and people-generated. However, they were not devoid of upgrades, as the sheltered paths could be seen through the blocks and parks found in this vicinity. There were a mix of new HDB blocks, recently built during the past 5 years as well as condominiums. The route would eventually lead south, cutting across Tampines Road into Hougang Ave 1, Lorong Ah Soo and Defu. The blocks along Hougang St 22 were newer in contrast to the previous vicinity, and it showed more state-provided community spaces. People-generated spaces found here were mostly found along low HDB blocks with first floor units, often developing the front area of their homes with gardens and sitting areas. Whether these spaces were accessible to all, it is unknown. Closer to the Hainanese Food Market, there were more state-provided community spaces. Interestingly, additional elements have been added to these spaces, giving them a more personalised feel. There are seven people-generated spaces found within Hougang, comprising of four outdoor spaces and three spaces found in void decks. Outdoor spaces are defined as spaecs beyond the boundaries of a HDB block and can be comprised of both sheltered and non-sheltered locations. There were many forms of gardens observed in Hougang, each with its own variety. However, the creation of these spaces are ambiguous; it is not clear if they are initiated by state instruments or the communities themselves. Hence, more conversations with residents of the gardens are needed to develop a clearer understanding on how they fit within the realm of people-generated spaces. 3.2 Images of the Spaces Figure 3.1: (Left) HG-V-19 - Corner of the void deck space, where residents have added a small storage area for materials of a nearby garden, with movable furniture. (Right) HG-V-20 - Well-furnished space in a void deck near a bus stop, with a mix of elements in furniture and the presence of Chinese decorations and religious ornaments HG-V-19 - Hiding in a corner HG-V-20 - Culturally standing out This space is found at the edge of the void deck and is reasonably hard to spot. Along with two benches provided by the state, an additional chair and foldable table are present, fitting in nicely at the corner. A locked storage compartment which as well as plastic drawers can be found in the space. While what is being stored is unknown, it could have a link with a small garden found adjacent to it that seems to also be people-generated. There are no cameras in this vicinity and its relatively secluded nature gives an impression that the community that uses this space would be rather small and quiet. The space is found at a void deck that is relatively close to a bus stop and a lift landing. While there is a table provided by the state, additional stone tables and benches are to found further from the lift landing. This could give the impression that the original space could not house the larger user capacity without blocking the path to the lift landing. Stacks of plastic chairs as well as stools can be found at the pillars of the space, with Chinese decorations on the walls and a small religious altar present. A small tin container can be seen as an ash tray for smokers. Pails and other types of equipment are stored behind the pillars to service the small plants that are grown towards the carpark at the back of the space, with Chinese decorations on them. This space does not have a camera but the provision of exercise equipment by the state, which looks rather new, would indicate that this space is accepted and known to exist for the residents. Due to its connectivity, people-watching would be a prominent activity, with its higher elevation and a good vantage point. Figure 3.2: (Left) HG-O-14 - A bench placed at the void deck, facing towards a garden. Positioned outside the first floor. (Right) HG-O-5 - A resident with a first floor table set up with chairs towards the back along a sheltered walkway HG-O-14 - Viewing the small garden HG-O-5 - Backend of a home A small outdoor space behind a first floor unit. As it is situated beside a walkway connecting HDB blocks together, a likely activity that happens here would be people watching, without being as exposed as placing the space in the front of the block where it lies along the main road. Also, due to its secluded nature, this space is most likely enjoyed by the resident who lives at the unit just beside it, hence it may not be a full community space for all. There are no cameras here. This space is situated near a first floor unit in the void deck. Consisting of two benches, it is a simple space. It is noticeably close to a small potted garden and provides a few of the surrounding area, while being relatively hidden itself. Whether it is a space that other residents can enjoy is not known. There are no cameras in this vicinity. Figure 3.3: HG-V-24 - Wooden seating and cabinets placed outside the state-provided community space and closer to a minimart. A lady sits on these added furniture facing the sheltered walkway that connects the nearby blocks together while having a conversation with the mini-mart owner. HG-V-24 - A quiet extension of a shop This space is found sandwiched between a minimart and a state-provided community space in a void deck. Wooden seating and cabinets can be found in the space, with a small cabinet housing a religious ornament on top. Additional stackable plastic chairs can be found here as well. While defintely small, it is unique in that residents chose to set up closer to the minimart, rather than just a few metres into the state-provided space. There are no cameras in this section of the space. "],
["bedok.html", "4 Bedok 4.1 Journey through Bedok 4.2 Images of the Spaces", " 4 Bedok The second neighbourhood to be explored in this research, Bedok is one of the largest planning neighbourhoods in Singapore, with close to 300,000 residents (Singstat, 2019). It is the fifth neighbourhood to be planned out by the Housing Development Board (HDB) in 1963 and has seen continuous development of the various land parcels with the reclamation of the east coast. Its name is similar to the Malay word bedoh, which means “drum”, as it was used by mosques as a signal to the settlements for times of prayer (National Library Board, n.d.). Even though it may have significant Malay origins, it is a neighbourhood that has seen much development that perpetuates the multi-cultural society in Singapore. With the quieter areas of Kaki Bukit, the private housing along Bedok reservoir as well as Siglap East and the bustling Bedok Town centre, Bedok is a diverse and amenity-rich neighbourhood. 4.1 Journey through Bedok Kaki Bukit, which is the north-western portion of Bedok, was the starting point to search for the people-generated spaces. While further away from the main Bedok hub, it still has its own town centre, found close to most of the HDB blocks. Nevertheless, maybe due to the COVID-19 implementations, there were few instances of people-generated spaces in this area, although some slight nuances require further investigation if this is true (clocks were found hanging at random void deck spaces near coffeeshops). Along the Bedok town park, towards the north, was found to be more private and people-generated spaces tended to appear, especially gardens that were randomly scattered along HDB pathways. People-generated spaces in this area gave a sense of retreat as they were situated at less visible locations and the outskirts of the HDB estates. Chai Chee, a mix of old and new developments west adjacent to the town centre , had interesting outdoor people-generated spaces which developed around seemingly ordinary objects such as trees. Expectedly, the new developments did not have any of these spaces. Fengshan, which is the eastern portion of Bedok and famous for its food, had relatively little people-generated spaces, other than a void deck space and some gardens. South of Bedok also shared this trait, and its people-generated spaces were found closer to watering holes such as coffeeshops. Most of the people-generated spaces were simply developed, with additional furniture found in the spaces. However, there were often strong cultural presences in these spaces, tending towards the Chinese ethnicity. While Bedok is a large HDB estate, it does not have a exceedingly large amount of void decks as the state bodies have developed amenities in these spaces since the neighbourhood has matured. While this could explain the scarcity in some of the locales in Bedok, it also creates an interesting point in the community’s preference for either state-provided spaces or their own people-generated spaces. 4.2 Images of the Spaces There are nine people-generated spaces found in Bedok, comprising of two void deck spaces and eight outdoor spaces. Figure 4.1: (Left) BD_O_01 - Adjacent sitting area to a lift landing where a sofa seat and wooden chairs have been provided, overlooking a small garden patch. (Right) BD_O_02 - Plastic chairs provided to a similar location as the left image, with a small religious altar and garden found just behind the lift landing BD-O-01 - Having a quiet view BD-O-02 - Hidden culture This space is adjacent to a lift landing that looks to have been developed during the lift upgrading programme (it extends out from the block). While wooden seating has been provided along the low wall, a sofa seat and additional wooden chairs have been provided in the immediate space. The camera serves the lift landing and hence, can see a portion of the space. The additional seats serve as a better arrangement especially during downpours as they are found in the deeper section of shelter as compared to the state-provided seats. Also, they have a vantage view of the surrounding vicinity, including the potted garden nearby and the canal just further down. This is space is adjacent to a lift landing that looks to have been developed during the lift upgrading programme. While wooden seating has been provided by the state, additional plastic chairs and tables can be found in the space. Similar to other spaces, they are arranged such that they are more sheltered against rain. Hidden from view is a religious altar that is placed behind the lift shaft extension under a tree. Residents that provided these chairs most likely are contributors to the altar as well, along with the potted garden found in the space. Similar to the other spaces, the camera can only see a certain portions of the seats, not the altar or the edge plastic seats. Figure 4.2: (Left) BD-O-06 - Stacked chairs with a makeshift storage area and hanging tools by the tree with a potted garden nearby creates an expansive and invested space by the residents (Right) BD-O-07 - Foldable tables and chairs set up under a tree, with a resident enjoying his time. A sitting spot for potential betters at the Singapore Pools BD-O-6 - Functioning under a tree BD-O-07 - Patiently waiting A space that is sandwiched between a basketball court and a sheltered walkway, it is umbrella-ed by a large tree. It has been heavily modified, with no state-provided seats or gardens found in the area yet plastic chairs and potted plants are arranged nicely in the space. The equipment for the plants, as well as a makeshift toolrack that is suspended from the tree branch, provides a mini-work area for the space, allowing the denizens of the space to work with organization. Locked cupboards and drawers are arranged nicely along the caged basketball court and it gives a sense of a well-contributed and maintained space. Also, modified gala poles with nets could be indicative that fruit picking is a possible activity in this space. Overall, this space creates a living space and is more advanced than other outdoor spaces. There are no cameras in the area. This is a small outdoor area built along a patch of grass, or sand. There are multiple tables folded under a tree, with plastic chairs stacked too. One was in use at the time of visit with the user facing the sheltered walkway found nearby. The close proximity to the Singapore Pools could be indicative of a gathering area where older folk would either make their bets or just play chess under the shelter of the tree. There are no cameras in this vicinity. Figure 4.3: (Left) BD-O-03 - Chairs are pulled away from the adjacent coffeeshop to a nearby shelter instead of using the wall benches. A shelter from the heat of the day but turning a large space into a significantly smaller one (Right) BD-O-04 - Another spot adjacent to a coffeeshop seeing high traffic across paths to get to the coffeeshop. With cabinets, tables and chairs, it extends the interaction from the coffeeshop to a more smoke-friendly location BD-O-03 - Seeking shelter BD-O-04 - Going beyond the coffeeshop A sheltered open space found adjacent to a coffeeshop, additional furniture from the coffeeshop is used while the state has already provided wall seats. In particular, this shelter also serves as a pathway from the sheltered walkways from adjacent blocks to the coffeeshop and the placement of the chairs further limits the walking space. Individuals were using this space as a resting area, although it remains to be seen if this is the primary usage due to current circumstances. There are no cameras in this space. An outdoor space that is found adjacent to a coffeeshop. With multiple foldable tables and plastic chairs that are taken from the coffeeshop, it provides a separated space from the commercial outlet. With the presence of cabinets and a toy bicycle, it would probably be frequented by regulars of the coffeeshop and it overlooks multiple pathways between blocks. Hence, people-watching may be a prominent activity here. Also, smoking is allowed in this space, since it is outdoor, which would probably be facilitated by the fact that the coffeeshop does not have a smoking corner. There are no cameras in this location. Figure 4.4: (Left) BD-O-05 - Rattan chairs are placed in a random manner, with a cooler box bicycle-locked to a bench. Possible drinking and smoking space due to the nearby coffeeshop and the skewness of the furniture towards outdoors.(Right) BD-0-08 - A living space that has personal elements hidden around an extended lift lobby. Incense holders, cultural decorations and wooden furniture leading out to the garden provides a sense of retreat. BD-O-05 - Extending the social space BD-O-08 - A retreat away Situated behind a lift landing, this space houses state-provided furniture, but with additional wooden chairs as well. These were laid out rather disorganized, probably indicating that this is not the original layout of the space. A cooler box was found chained to one of the chairs, which suggests that drinking was often an activity. Along with its proximity to a coffeeshop and large vantage view of the surrounding HDB estate, it would be a space of relaxation and conversation, akin to a watering hole. Re-classified from a garden to an outdoor space as most of the space is generated within an outdoor shelter situated behind a lift landing. A people-generated space, without any state-provided furniture or demarcation of space. Within the space, there are cabinets and side tables, with wooden and plastic movable chairs provided. Calenders and Chinese ornaments can be found on these cabinets, as well as an incense burner. A small garden is developed just outside the space, with a small fence bounding the potted plants. No cameras as it is hidden behind the lift landing. Figure 4.5: (Left) BD-V-03 - Wooden and plastic chairs arranged nicely along the wall, for a much larger gathering than the intended 6-seater provided table. Chinese decorations hung around with a clock nearby, giving an impression of a space where people passed the time. (Right) BD-V-09 - More seating provided through wooden and plastic chairs beside a minimart space, with rags and containers (unseen in the photo) ‘decorating’ the area. BD-V-03 - A place to meet BD-V-09 - Spending time at the minimart The space is found at the void deck edge of a HDB block, with a sheltered walkway directly leading into it. While state-provided furniture is present, additional chairs, both wooden and plastic, are lined against the wall. Also, a wooden table is placed there. Chinese decorations hang from the ceiling, with a homely clock providing the time to possible users of the space. The layout of the additional furniture is not representative of the real usage of the space, due to current circumstances and the tape surrounding it. Hence, there could be more elements to this space yet it is unseen. There are no cameras in the vicinity. This space has a few additions to the state-provided elements.Additional seats have been provided, not exactly near the table but in an open fashion. It is also tending towards the minimart adjacent to the space. Cabinets with clothes hung could indicate who are the probable users of the space; shopowners. However, residents of the area seem to be freely able to use the space as well though the furniture does block an entry point to the shop. There are not cameras in the vicinity. "],
["ang-mo-kio.html", "5 Ang Mo Kio 5.1 Journey through Ang Mo Kio 5.2 Images of the Spaces", " 5 Ang Mo Kio Ang Mo Kio is the youngest among the three neighbourhoods explored in this project but it has a variety of HDB estates throughout. Interestingly, Ang Mo Kio has been experiencing high valuation of its housing developments in recent years which could be due to the good amount of neighbourhood upgrading such as bicycle pathways. As compared to the neighbourhoods of Hougang and Bedok, it has a relatively higher proportion of private housing in its estate and good access to parks. These amenities have given Ang Mo Kio residents a good connection to a variety of lifestyles. 5.1 Journey through Ang Mo Kio Starting from the eastern portion of Ang Mo Kio, which is the Cheng San and Teck Ghee HDB estates, there are interesting types of spaces, both state-provided and people-generated. The HDB developments in these areas are relatively older, with only one section near the highway interchange being newly developed. As such, amenities such as coffeeshops, resident corners and elderly care centres are distributed quite evenly. That being said, people-generated spaces found here are in a more personalised nature, with even signs of working activity taking place in these spaces (work table rather than dining tables and washing points with equipment). There is also a certain lull in these spaces, with the setups tending towards longer occupation within the spaces. Towards the central and western portions of Ang Mo Kio provides more nuanced spaces, with back corners showing more privacy, seating placement facing towards roads and walkways encouraging people-watching and an advanced space resembling a shared living room in the middle of the void deck. The northern portions of Ang Mo Kio has a different elevation and hence, different style of HDB estates and layouts. The Kebun Baru and Yio Chu Kang areas are relatively simple, with only one significant people-generated space near a garden. Gardens are prominent in this area as with the different elevations, it provided for nice corners of getaways for residents. Ang Mo Kio has ten people-generated spaces comprising of three outdoor spaces and seven void deck spaces. 5.2 Images of the Spaces Figure 5.1: (Left) AK-V-01 - Plastic chairs stacked and chained to the metal benches to provide flexible seating around the pillars that obstruct each bench. (Right) AK-V-02 - Chairs and drawers containers plastic cups and bottles placed at a common void deck, adjacent to sheltered walkway connecting the blocks AK-V-01 - Unassuming and simple AK-V-02 - Extending the seats This void deck space is easily missed due to the placement of pillars throughout the space and an awkward presence of state-provided benches that accompany each pillar. Stacked plastic chairs can be seen chained to one of these benches, where an elderly man sits. A folded table top is found in the corner of one of the pillars. Personal items are placed on a stack of plastic chairs at a nearby washing point. The layout is uncertain, since the chairs remained stacked, but the location is overlooking a nearby carpark, while also near the town centre. It seems to have a decent traffic of non-users, as it is near a mailbox and a lift landing. There are no cameras overlooking the space. A void deck seating area that is situated near the sheltered walkway between HDB blocks and the nearby bus stop. While there is state provision of the fixed red furniture and metal benches, additional seats can be found filling the gap along a wall. Also, there is a small drawer cabinet hosting plastic items with water bottles found nearby. While the purpose of the bottles is unclear, these items are not locked or secured. Yet, it seems to be relatively safe. A camera provided by the state is present but it seems unlikely to be provided as security for these items and rather more towards the space serving as an entrance to the sheltered paths. Interestingly, the adjacent void deck space has folded tables as well as a signage on a limit on the quantity of tables to be used. This could be indicative of state-support for this space. Figure 5.2: (Left) AK-V-05 - A living space erupts at a void deck beside a barricaded store. Fridges that draw power provision from the store with the complementing furniture provided, gives a rather personalised space of interaction. (Right) AK-V-06 - Chairs stack in all manners at this vantage space, where sheltered walkways meet, going to adjacent blocks and across the two coffeeshops found nearby AK-V-05 - A living space in the void AK-V-06 - Viewing the traffic This space is rather unique; it has a makeshift store found beside it. It is interesting to find a store that seems to be under the care of residents. This space is also without any state-provided furniture, essentially providing a new sitting space in a void. Tables that look more like household dining tables rather than sitting tables and homely wooden chairs gives it heterogeneous design. Stacks of plastic chairs can be found organized nicely against a wall. The presence of fridges and freezes allows the space to provide beverages or food. Along with fans and an exercise machine, it creates the impression of a living space. It is populated by residents during the trips, both in the late morning and late afternoon. There are no cameras in this space but the provision of power in a void deck (normally not possible) would indicate that the authorities know such a space exists. This space in the void deck consists of additional seats, with wooden chairs being the primary aesthetic and stacked in the corner. It is a confluence of multiple covered walkways, linking an adjacent coffeeshop with a pedestrian crossing towards another coffeeshop. Hence, this space sees much traffic as well. While there are metal benches provided by the state, the orientation of furniture that are set up by residents faces the view of the pedestrian crossing, being in an elevated position. It can be deduced this space is mostly used for people-watching. In fact, there was an elderly woman sitting in such a position. There are no cameras in this vicinity. Figure 5.3: (Left) AK-V-07 - A table tennis table attempts to hide the wooden chairs that hang around it. (Right) AK-V-09 - A myriad of different furniture placed in a rather non-orderly manner impresses a buzz in the vicinity, especially since the block where basic neighbourhood functions are provided is found across it AK-V-07 - More than sports AK-V-09 - A quaint space for activity A table tennis table that was provided by the state, some wooden chairs have been added to the space. They are placed beneath the table, in a manner that creates an impression of hiding, which could postulate that they may not exactly be accepted. However, it is a simple layout, and it could indicate the table tennis either being highly used, with the chairs as waiting seats, or the table is being used for other activities than the sport. There are no cameras in this vicinity. A space with a variation of furniture, mostly tables and chairs. A rocking chair can be seen placed facing the nearby road, which serves the back end of block of shops. People watching could be a prominent activity here, as it has a good vantage view of activities. A table with locked drawers can be found as well, which could indicate this space could encourage some form of handiwork. Other people-generated furniture can be seen haphazardly stored in a corner, with trolleys. The area is also decorated with various Chinese ornaments and decorations from the ceiling and walls, giving the impression that a Chinese-dominant demographic inhabits such a space. There are no cameras in this vicinity. Figure 5.4: (Left) AK-V-12 - A hidden corner serving the utility rooms of the block provides shade and a small smoking corner for its users. (Right) AK-O-01 - Hidden behind a famous chicken rice franchise lies a gathering corner with varying types of seats available and a potted environment for privacy AK-V-12 - A short break from work AK-O-01 - Behind the kitchen A very small space, set up near the utility room of the HDB block. Importanly, it is not visible at most angles, which could probably facilitate its hidden nature and possibility, the lack of state knowledge. There are additional seating provided, along with a mirror and an ash tray. This gives the impression that this area is a resting space for workers that have to maintain these rooms, with shelter for hot and wet weather as well as the mirror for facial maintenance. An outdoor space found just behind a coffeeshop. Non-sheltered, users have set up chairs, placed behind the pots and plants. Clearly people-generated, there is no demarcation of the space. Looking at the proximity to the coffeeshop, it is more than likely setup by the staff of the coffeeshop rather than a larger community initiative. All the furniture are heterogeneous, and there is a possibility it is also used as a smoking corner, with visibility being minimal. There are no cameras by the state of the users in the space. Figure 5.5: (Left) AK-O-02 - Stacks of wooden benches give evidence of a popular outdoor space adjacent to a coffeeshop and the lorry park nearby. (Right) AK-O-03 - Additional chairs and a dustbin give residents more flexibility in using this shelter that overlooks the nearby food centre and a small community garden beside it AK-O-O2 - Carpark viewing AK-O-03 - Chilling by the garden An outdoor space found adjacent to a coffeeshop and an outdoor carpark that is dominated by large vehicles. Multiple wooden benches are stacked haphazardly in the corner, an indication of times when these could be laid out for more informal gatherings, adding on to the existing chairs at the perimeter of the space. As they were not laid out, it is unsure how the layout is however, it could be a gathering space for truck or bus drivers to have a smoke before or after work. There are no cameras in this vicinity. While it is under a state-provided shelter, it is considered to be an outdoor space. Additional chairs have been provided in this space, which is at the junction of a sheltered walkway and the path to the bus stop and pedestrian crossing. Also, a dustbin has been provided there. Whilst most likely not for smoking, due to the nature of it being plastic, it gives the impression of a place of ‘stay’. Two of the users of the space had gone to see a small community garden just a few metres away, with another fellow member tending to the garden. This could be a regular activity for them, since the seats do provide a vantage view of the garden and the crossings for people-watching. No cameras on site. "],
["findings.html", "6 Findings 6.1 Simple People-generated Spaces 6.2 Advanced People-generated Spaces", " 6 Findings This section focuses on the overall look at how people-generated spaces are found within the three neighbourhoods as well as the possible forms they take and the functions of the space which are expanded. Cataloging of the spaces required characteristics that could bind the different forms of people-generated spaces into logical groups. Since diversity of these spaces would result in difficulties in grouping such spaces, the research focuses instead on the degree of spatial interventions made by residents to these spaces.. Two logical groups are hence formed, being simple and advanced. The simple group looks at the contributions of users within the space which increased the capabilities of the space but does not modify the functions of what the space was intended to be. For example, the addition of chairs and generic tables increase the capacity of a void deck seating area but does not add a new activity or function of the seating space. Spaces within the advanced group have interventions that modifies the functions of the provided space according to the needs to the users. For example, the provision of fridges and pantries to a void deck space no longer just provides a simple seating space, but also provides more elements of ‘stay’ with food and beverage consumption. Category of People-Generated Spaces Number Advanced 6 Simple 21 Of the 27 people-generated spaces that are discovered, 21 fall under the simple category while 6 fall under the advanced categories. Majority of these spaces are considered simple as they add simple items that do not modify the space much, which includes additional chairs and tables, and do not necessarily change the function of the space. AK-0-03 is an example of such a space. 6.1 Simple People-generated Spaces Figure 6.1: AK_V_06 - A small sitting area, currently packed up A seating area with a view This space in the void deck consists of additional seats, with wooden chairs being the primary aesthetic and stacked in the corner. It is a confluence of multiple covered walkways, linking an adjacent coffeeshop with a pedestrian crossing towards another coffeeshop. Hence, this space sees much traffic as well. While there are metal benches provided by the state, the orientation of furniture that are set up by residents faces the view of the pedestrian crossing, being in an elevated position. It can be deduced this space is mostly used for people-watching. In fact, there was an elderly woman sitting in such a position. There are no cameras in this vicinity. The formation of simple people-generated spaces does not necessarily translate to a lack of seating capacity of the space, but it also could imply the orientation of the current seats do not fit the preferences of residents using the space. The spaces listed below show a capacity of seats provided that is deemed sufficient and not an extraordinary amount of additional furniture being added. However, they do have a nice viewing range of the surrounding area which the state-provided seats do not capture, and hance, in the context of activities such as people-watching, encourage people to instead provide their own seating preferences. HG_O_14 HG-V-24 BD_O_01 BD_O_02 BD_O_03 BD_O_05 BD_O_07 BD_O_09 AK_V_01 AK_V_02 AK_O_02 Some spaces do postulate a lack of provision by the state, though it is not necessarily a case of insufficiency but the nature of how the communities that create these spaces gather. An example would be AK_O_01, which is situated at the back of a coffeeshop. Figure 6.2: AK_O_01 - A space behind a coffeeshop A quiet space behind a coffeeshop An outdoor space found just behind a coffeeshop. Non-sheltered, users have set up chairs, placed behind the pots and plants. Clearly people-generated, there is no demarcation of the space. Looking at the proximity to the coffeeshop, it is more than likely setup by the staff of the coffeeshop rather than a larger community initiative. All the furniture are heterogeneous, and there is a possibility it is also used as a smoking corner, with visibility being minimal. There are no cameras by the state of the users in the space. It is not common to have community spaces directly behind the kitchens of a coffeeshop due to the fumes and the lack of nice view. However, these areas serve a different form of community; the staff working at the shops. They may not be able to travel far to other community spaces amidst their breaks and if they would want to enjoy a certain peace, the rear of a coffeeshop where no one walks is a good place to set up a space. The visibility of the space allows the users a short getaway from the bustle in front of them, while keeping them close enough to react to any duties they need to attend. It is also worth noting that AK-O-01 has a mini garden that is probably tended to by the staff, as a community garden set up by the state can be found barely 10 metres away from this space. As community gardens often have exclusive access, this space tends to allow the staff, who would not be residents, to have a space of their own. There are other spaces that too follow such trends, being close to amenities but in locations where it would not be most favourable for development in theory. Figure 6.3: (Left to Right) AK_O_02, BD_O_04, BD_O_07 Figure 6.4: (Left to Right) AK_O_02, BD_O_04, BD_O_07 Figure 6.5: (Left to Right) AK_O_02, BD_O_04, BD_O_07 6.2 Advanced People-generated Spaces Figure 6.6: BD_O_06, an advanced people-generated space that creates a work and sitting area to cater to the nearby garden and fruit tree The five advanced people-generated spaces found in the three neighbourhoods have increased the functions of the spaces of which they were originally designed. Extending beyond the provision of additional flexibility in sitting or people-watching activities as well as increasing load of the space, their modifications are reactive to the environment that they are set within. The people-generated space of BD_O_06 is formed around a tree which has no prior state provided elements. The evolution of functions within the space can be seen with the potted garden that has grown within it, equipment storage that serve both stewardship of the garden and the tree as well as multiple chairs just for seating. Nearby HDB blocks house provision shops and a hardware store, and this space creates a sense of activity that is not unlike the amenities found in close proximity. (Insert a map of surrounding vicinity and this space) Figure 6.7: AK_V_05, an advanced people-generated space that creates a living space at a void deck, full a range of electrical appliances for multiple conveniences AK_V_05 is an interesting relocated space. Initially, due to a construction hoarding nearby, it was not clear what this space entailed. Upon further investigation through Google Street View, the makeshift store was constructed to house the items from the ongoing renovation of the senior citizens corner. The layout of the relocated furniture, which have been provided by residents, resembles that of a gathering space, with lighting provided for reading as if it were in a normal HDB unit. While unique that it has electrical power sources due to the relocation, resident’s choice of furniture and appliances in the open is an impression for the activities that take place in this space. A cross-trainer exercise machine can be found in the corner, with natural draft coming in from that direction. The heterogeneity of elements within this space speaks about the contributions of the residents into developing this living space or even the previous senior citizen corner; diverse yet focused on comfort to their preference. Figure 6.8: HG_V_20, an advanced people-generated space that has a strong cultural and old school vibe with the types of furniture and ornaments present HG_V_20 is a unique people-generated space found in a void deck near a bus stop. While there are not any prominent amenities nearby such as coffeeshops or provision shops, this space is rather developed and invested in by a community. In fact, the nearest coffeeshop is found across the main road which is a considerable distance away. With the mix of dated furniture such as stone bences and newer plastic types, this space pops out with its own personality. Compounding on the heterogeneity is the presence of religious ornaments, pictures and decorations of pre-dominantly Chinese origin. Religion has always been seen as a personal element and its existence here could impress upon a particular demographic that enjoys the space and has a connection that has been built over time. It is important to note that such elements may deter the idea of inclusivity, as not every resident will fall under the particular religion that is depicted here. "],

The characteristics help to serve as themes of discussion on what the forms that people-generated spaces undertake and in turn, what would need to be further understood. The characteristics are as follows: diversity, free, delineated, balance accessibility, comfort, adequacy of seating.

Location ID Type of Space Remarks AK-O-01 Outdoor An outdoor space found just behind a coffeeshop. Non-sheltered, users have set up chairs, placed behind the pots and plants. Clearly people-generated, there is no demarcation of the space. Looking at the proximity to the coffeeshop, it is more than likely setup by the staff of the coffeeshop rather than a larger community initiative. All the furniture are heterogeneous, and there is a possibility it is also used as a smoking corner, with visibility being minimal. There are no cameras by the state of the users in the space. AK-O-02 Outdoor An outdoor space found adjacent to a coffeeshop and an outdoor carpark that is dominated by large vehicles. Multiple wooden benches are stacked haphazardly in the corner, an indication of times when these could be laid out for more informal gatherings, adding on to the existing chairs at the perimeter of the space. As they were not laid out, it is unsure how the layout is however, it could be a gathering space for truck or bus drivers to have a smoke before or after work. There are no cameras in this vicinity. AK-O-03 Outdoor While it is under a state-provided shelter, it is considered to be an outdoor space. Additional chairs have been provided in this space, which is at the junction of a sheltered walkway and the path to the bus stop and pedestrian crossing. Also, a dustbin has been provided there. Whilst most likely not for smoking, due to the nature of it being plastic, it gives the impression of a place of ‘stay’. Two of the users of the space had gone to see a small community garden just a few metres away, with another fellow member tending to the garden. This could be a regular activity for them, since the seats do provide a vantage view of the garden and the crossings for people-watching. No cameras on site. AK-V-01 Void Deck This void deck space is easily missed due to the placement of pillars throughout the space and an awkward presence of state-provided benches that accompany each pillar. Stacked plastic chairs can be seen chained to one of these benches, where an elderly man sits. A folded table top is found in the corner of one of the pillars. Personal items are placed on a stack of plastic chairs at a nearby washing point. The layout is uncertain, since the chairs remained stacked, but the location is overlooking a nearby carpark, while also near the town centre. It seems to have a decent traffic of non-users, as it is near a mailbox and a lift landing. There are no cameras overlooking the space. AK-V-02 Void Deck A void deck seating area that is situated near the sheltered walkway between HDB blocks and the nearby bus stop. While there is state provision of the fixed red furniture and metal benches, additional seats can be found filling the gap along a wall. Also, there is a small drawer cabinet hosting plastic items with water bottles found nearby. While the purpose of the bottles is unclear, these items are not locked or secured. Yet, it seems to be relatively safe. A camera provided by the state is present but it seems unlikely to be provided as security for these items and rather more towards the space serving as an entrance to the sheltered paths. Interestingly, the adjacent void deck space has folded tables as well as a signage on a limit on the quantity of tables to be used. This could be indicative of state-support for this space. AK-V-05 Void Deck This space is rather unique; it has a makeshift store found beside it. It is interesting to find a store that seems to be under the care of residents. This space is also without any state-provided furniture, essentially providing a new sitting space in a void. Tables that look more like household dining tables rather than sitting tables and homely wooden chairs gives it heterogeneous design. Stacks of plastic chairs can be found organized nicely against a wall. The presence of fridges and freezes allows the space to provide beverages or food. Along with fans and an exercise machine, it creates the impression of a living space. It is populated by residents during the trips, both in the late morning and late afternoon. There are no cameras in this space but the provision of power in a void deck (normally not possible) would indicate that the authorities know such a space exists. AK-V-06 Void Deck This space in the void deck consists of additional seats, with wooden chairs being the primary aesthetic and stacked in the corner. It is a confluence of multiple covered walkways, linking an adjacent coffeeshop with a pedestrian crossing towards another coffeeshop. Hence, this space sees much traffic as well. While there are metal benches provided by the state, the orientation of furniture that are set up by residents faces the view of the pedestrian crossing, being in an elevated position. It can be deduced this space is mostly used for people-watching. In fact, there was an elderly woman sitting in such a position. There are no cameras in this vicinity. AK-V-07 Void Deck A table tennis table that was provided by the state, some wooden chairs have been added to the space. They are placed beneath the table, in a manner that creates an impression of hiding, which could postulate that they may not exactly be accepted. However, it is a simple layout, and it could indicate the table tennis either being highly used, with the chairs as waiting seats, or the table is being used for other activities than the sport. There are no cameras in this vicinity. AK-V-09 Void Deck A space with a variation of furniture, mostly tables and chairs. A rocking chair can be seen placed facing the nearby road, which serves the back end of block of shops. People watching could be a prominent activity here, as it has a good vantage view of activities. A table with locked drawers can be found as well, which could indicate this space could encourage some form of handiwork. Other people-generated furniture can be seen haphazardly stored in a corner, with trolleys. The area is also decorated with various Chinese ornaments and decorations from the ceiling and walls, giving the impression that a Chinese-dominant demographic inhabits such a space. There are no cameras in this vicinity. AK-V-12 Void Deck A very small space, set up near the utility room of the HDB block. Importanly, it is not visible at most angles, which could probably facilitate its hidden nature and possibility, the lack of state knowledge. There are additional seating provided, along with a mirror and an ash tray. This gives the impression that this area is a resting space for workers that have to maintain these rooms, with shelter for hot and wet weather as well as the mirror for facial maintenance. BD-O-01 Outdoor This space is adjacent to a lift landing that looks to have been developed during the lift upgrading programme (it extends out from the block). While wooden seating has been provided along the low wall, a sofa seat and additional wooden chairs have been provided in the immediate space. The camera serves the lift landing and hence, can see a portion of the space. The additional seats serve as a better arrangement especially during downpours as they are found in the deeper section of shelter as compared to the state-provided seats. Also, they have a vantage view of the surrounding vicinity, including the potted garden nearby and the canal just further down. BD-O-02 Outdoor This is space is adjacent to a lift landing that looks to have been developed during the lift upgrading programme. While wooden seating has been provided by the state, additional plastic chairs and tables can be found in the space. Similar to other spaces, they are arranged such that they are more sheltered against rain. Hidden from view is a religious altar that is placed behind the lift shaft extension under a tree. Residents that provided these chairs most likely are contributors to the altar as well, along with the potted garden found in the space. Similar to the other spaces, the camera can only see a certain portions of the seats, not the altar or the edge plastic seats. BD-O-03 Outdoor A sheltered open space found adjacent to a coffeeshop, additional furniture from the coffeeshop is used while the state has already provided wall seats. In particular, this shelter also serves as a pathway from the sheltered walkways from adjacent blocks to the coffeeshop and the placement of the chairs further limits the walking space. Individuals were using this space as a resting area, although it remains to be seen if this is the primary usage due to current circumstances. There are no cameras in this space. BD-O-04 Outdoor An outdoor space that is found adjacent to a coffeeshop. With multiple foldable tables and plastic chairs that are taken from the coffeeshop, it provides a separated space from the commercial outlet. With the presence of cabinets and a toy bicycle, it would probably be frequented by regulars of the coffeeshop and it overlooks multiple pathways between blocks. Hence, people-watching may be a prominent activity here. Also, smoking is allowed in this space, since it is outdoor, which would probably be facilitated by the fact that the coffeeshop does not have a smoking corner. There are no cameras in this location. BD-O-05 Outdoor Situated behind a lift landing, this space houses state-provided furniture, but with additional wooden chairs as well. These were laid out rather disorganized, probably indicating that this is not the original layout of the space. A cooler box was found chained to one of the chairs, which suggests that drinking was often an activity. Along with its proximity to a coffeeshop and large vantage view of the surrounding HDB estate, it would be a space of relaxation and conversation, akin to a watering hole. BD-O-06 Outdoor A space that is sandwiched between a basketball court and a sheltered walkway, it is umbrella-ed by a large tree. It has been heavily modified, with no state-provided seats or gardens found in the area yet plastic chairs and potted plants are arranged nicely in the space. The equipment for the plants, as well as a makeshift toolrack that is suspended from the tree branch, provides a mini-work area for the space, allowing the denizens of the space to work with organization. Locked cupboards and drawers are arranged nicely along the caged basketball court and it gives a sense of a well-contributed and maintained space. Also, modified gala poles with nets could be indicative that fruit picking is a possible activity in this space. Overall, this space creates a living space and is more advanced than other outdoor spaces. There are no cameras in the area. BD-O-07 Outdoor This is a small outdoor area built along a patch of grass, or sand. There are multiple tables folded under a tree, with plastic chairs stacked too. One was in use at the time of visit with the user facing the sheltered walkway found nearby. The close proximity to the Singapore Pools could be indicative of a gathering area where older folk would either make their bets or just play chess under the shelter of the tree. There are no cameras in this vicinity. BD-O-08 Outdoor Re-classified from a garden to an outdoor space as most of the space is generated within an outdoor shelter situated behind a lift landing. A people-generated space, without any state-provided furniture or demarcation of space. Within the space, there are cabinets and side tables, with wooden and plastic movable chairs provided. Calenders and Chinese ornaments can be found on these cabinets, as well as an incense burner. A small garden is developed just outside the space, with a small fence bounding the potted plants. No cameras as it is hidden behind the lift landing. BD-V-03 Void Deck The space is found at the void deck edge of a HDB block, with a sheltered walkway directly leading into it. While state-provided furniture is present, additional chairs, both wooden and plastic, are lined against the wall. Also, a wooden table is placed there. Chinese decorations hang from the ceiling, with a homely clock providing the time to possible users of the space. The layout of the additional furniture is not representative of the real usage of the space, due to current circumstances and the tape surrounding it. Hence, there could be more elements to this space yet it is unseen. There are no cameras in the vicinity. BD-V-09 Void Deck This space has a few additions to the state-provided elements.Additional seats have been provided, not exactly near the table but in an open fashion. It is also tending towards the minimart adjacent to the space. Cabinets with clothes hung could indicate who are the probable users of the space; shopowners. However, residents of the area seem to be freely able to use the space as well though the furniture does block an entry point to the shop. There are not cameras in the vicinity. HG-O-05 Outdoor A small outdoor space behind a first floor unit. As it is situated beside a walkway connecting HDB blocks together, a likely activity that happens here would be people watching, without being as exposed as placing the space in the front of the block where it lies along the main road. Also, due to its secluded nature, this space is most likely enjoyed by the resident who lives at the unit just beside it, hence it may not be a full community space for all. There are no cameras here. HG-O-14 Outdoor This space is situated near a first floor unit in the void deck. Consisting of two benches, it is a simple space. It is noticeably close to a small potted garden and provides a few of the surrounding area, while being relatively hidden itself. Whether it is a space that other residents can enjoy is not known. There are no cameras in this vicinity. HG-O-15 Outdoor An outdoor area that consists of a garden. Mostly feeding into the units found on the first floor of these spaces. There are various ornaments present, religious and cultural. Also, bird cages can be found in this vicinity, which promotes both activities of bird watching and people-watching. HG-O-16 Outdoor This space covers a stretch of a shelter walkway beside a school and connecting two HDB blocks. Multiple tables and chairs have been placed, focusing towards the direction of the school and two large burning containers (probably used for religious purposes). There do not obstruct the passage way, instead running in parallel with the pillars. There are no cameras in this area. HG-V-19 Void Deck This space is found at the edge of the void deck and is reasonably hard to spot. Along with two benches provided by the state, an additional chair and foldable table are present, fitting in nicely at the corner. A locked storage compartment which as well as plastic drawers can be found in the space. While what is being stored is unknown, it could have a link with a small garden found adjacent to it that seems to also be people-generated. There are no cameras in this vicinity and its relatively secluded nature gives an impression that the community that uses this space would be rather small and quiet. HG-V-20 Void Deck The space is found at a void deck that is relatively close to a bus stop and a lift landing. While there is a table provided by the state, additional stone tables and benches are to found further from the lift landing. This could give the impression that the original space could not house the larger user capacity without blocking the path to the lift landing. Stacks of plastic chairs as well as stools can be found at the pillars of the space, with Chinese decorations on the walls and a small religious altar present. A small tin container can be seen as an ash tray for smokers. Pails and other types of equipment are stored behind the pillars to service the small plants that are grown towards the carpark at the back of the space, with Chinese decorations on them. This space does not have a camera but the provision of exercise equipment by the state, which looks rather new, would indicate that this space is accepted and known to exist for the residents. Due to its connectivity, people-watching would be a prominent activity, with its higher elevation and a good vantage point. HG-V-24 Void Deck This space is found sandwiched between a minimart and a state-provided community space in a void deck. Wooden seating and cabinets can be found in the space, with a small cabinet housing a religious ornament on top. Additional stackable plastic chairs can be found here as well. While defintely small, it is unique in that residents chose to set up closer to the minimart, rather than just a few metres into the state-provided space. There are no cameras in this section of the space. ## # A tibble: 10 x 3 ## `Location ID` `Type of Space` Remarks ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 AK-O-03 Outdoor &quot;While it is under a state-provided shelter, i… ## 2 AK-V-02 Void Deck &quot;A void deck seating area that is situated nea… ## 3 AK-V-06 Void Deck &quot;This space in the void deck consists of addit… ## 4 BD-O-03 Outdoor &quot;A sheltered open space found adjacent to a co… ## 5 BD-O-04 Outdoor &quot;An outdoor space that is found adjacent to a … ## 6 BD-O-06 Outdoor &quot;A space that is sandwiched between a basketba… ## 7 BD-O-07 Outdoor &quot;This is a small outdoor area built along a pa… ## 8 BD-V-03 Void Deck &quot;The space is found at the void deck edge of a… ## 9 HG-O-05 Outdoor &quot;A small outdoor space behind a first floor un… ## 10 HG-O-16 Outdoor &quot;This space covers a stretch of a shelter walk… ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## `Location ID` `Type of Space` Remarks ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 AK-O-01 Outdoor &quot;An outdoor space found just behind a coffeesho… ## 2 AK-O-02 Outdoor &quot;An outdoor space found adjacent to a coffeesho… ## 3 BD-O-05 Outdoor &quot;Situated behind a lift landing, this space hou… PGS_nongardens %&gt;% count(`Seating Types`) ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## `Seating Types` n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Mixed 13 ## 2 Mobile 13 ## 3 None 1 PGS_nongardens %&gt;% filter(`Seating Types`==&quot;Mobile&quot;) ## # A tibble: 13 x 14 ## `Location ID` Group Category `Type of Space` Security Demarcation Cleanliness ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 AK-O-01 Simp… People-… Outdoor No Not demarc… Semi-clean ## 2 AK-V-05 Adva… People-… Void Deck No Not demarc… Semi-clean ## 3 AK-V-07 Simp… People-… Void Deck No Not demarc… Clean ## 4 AK-V-12 Simp… People-… Void Deck No Not demarc… Clean ## 5 BD-O-04 Simp… People-… Outdoor No Not demarc… Semi-clean ## 6 BD-O-06 Adva… People-… Outdoor No Not demarc… Clean ## 7 BD-O-07 Simp… People-… Outdoor No Not demarc… Clean ## 8 BD-O-08 Adva… People-… Outdoor No Not demarc… Clean ## 9 HG-O-05 Simp… People-… Outdoor No Not demarc… Clean ## 10 HG-O-14 Simp… People-… Outdoor No Not demarc… Semi-clean ## 11 HG-O-16 Simp… People-… Outdoor No Not demarc… Clean ## 12 HG-V-20 Adva… People-… Void Deck No Not demarc… Clean ## 13 HG-V-24 Simp… People-… Void Deck No Not demarc… Clean ## # … with 7 more variables: `Seating Types` &lt;chr&gt;, `Seating Capacity` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # `Electrical appliances` &lt;chr&gt;, `Ornaments and Decorations` &lt;chr&gt;, ## # lat &lt;dbl&gt;, lon &lt;dbl&gt;, Remarks &lt;chr&gt; "],
["themes.html", "8 Themes 8.1 Preferences versus Sufficiency 8.2 Limitations of duty versus Personality 8.3 Privacy versus Surveillance", " 8 Themes Through the analysis of modified characteristics mentioned in the previous section, three main themes can be ascertained from people-generated spaces and their development within HDB estates in Singapore. These are the preferences versus sufficiency, limitations of duty versus personality and privacy vs surveillance. 8.1 Preferences versus Sufficiency The spaces observed in the research displayed an empowerment of residents to build or modify spaces in accordance to various motivations. Unlike other community initiative projects in other countries, whereby there was an insufficiency of amenities provided by the state, people-generated spaces in Singapore tended towards the preference of the residents’ on how the the space should be developed. This was clear in spaces with adequate capacity of benches and seats provided by the state but additional chairs were provided for flexible arrangement and seating. 8.2 Limitations of duty versus Personality 8.3 Privacy versus Surveillance "]
