Cataloging of the spaces required characteristics that could bind the different forms of people-generated spaces into logical groups. Since diversity of these spaces would result in difficulties in grouping such spaces, the research focuses instead on the degree of spatial interventions made by residents to these spaces.. Two logical groups are hence formed, being simple and advanced. The simple group looks at the contributions of users within the space which increased the capabilities of the space but does not modify the functions of what the space was intended to be. For example, the addition of chairs and generic tables increase the capacity of a void deck seating area but does not add a new activity or function of the seating space. Spaces within the advanced group have interventions that modifies the functions of the provided space according to the needs to the users. For example, the provision of fridges and pantries to a void deck space no longer just provides a simple seating space, but also provides more elements of ‘stay’ with food and beverage consumption. Category of People-Generated Spaces Number Advanced 5 Simple 21 Of the 26 people-generated spaces that are discovered, 21 fall under the simple category while 5 fall under the advanced categories. Majority of these spaces are considered simple as they add simple items that do not modify the space much, which includes additional chairs and tables, and do not necessarily change the function of the space. AK-0-03 is an example of such a space. 6.1 Simple People-generated Spaces Figure 6.1: AK_V_06 - A small sitting area, currently packed up A seating area with a view This space in the void deck consists of additional seats, with wooden chairs being the primary aesthetic and stacked in the corner. It is a confluence of multiple covered walkways, linking an adjacent coffeeshop with a pedestrian crossing towards another coffeeshop. Hence, this space sees much traffic as well. While there are metal benches provided by the state, the orientation of furniture that are set up by residents faces the view of the pedestrian crossing, being a elevated position. It can be deduced this space is mostly used for people-watching. There was an elderly woman sitting in such a position. There are no cameras in this vicinity. The formation of simple people-generated spaces does not necessarily translate to a lack of seating capacity of the space, but it also could imply the orientation of the current seats do not fit the preferences of residents using the space. The spaces listed below show a capacity of seats provided that is deemed sufficient and not an extraordinary amount of additional furniture being added. However, they do have a nice viewing range of the surrounding area which the state-provided seats do not capture, and hance, in the context of activities such as people-watching, encourage people to instead provide their own seating preferences.

An example would be AK_O_01, which is situated at the back of a coffeeshop. Figure 6.2: AK_O_01 - A space behind a coffeeshop Simple02&lt;-PGS_nongardens %&gt;% filter(`Location ID`==&quot;AK-O-01&quot;) %&gt;% select(Remarks) kable(Simple02,col.names = &quot;A quiet space behind a coffeeshop&quot;) %&gt;% column_spec(1:1,width = 5,background = &quot;#F6DDCC &quot;) A quiet space behind a coffeeshop An outdoor space found just behind a coffeeshop. Non-sheltered, users have set up chairs, placed behind the pots and plants. Clearly people-generated, there is no demarcation of the space. Looking at the proximity to the coffeeshop, it is more than likely setup by the staff of the coffeeshop rather than a larger community initiative. All the furniture are heterogeneous, and there is a possibility it is also used as a smoking corner, with visibility being minimal. There are no cameras by the state of the users in the space. It is not common to have community spaces directly behind the kitchens of a coffeeshop due to the fumes and the lack of nice view. However, these areas serve a different form of community; the staff working at the shops. They may not be able to travel far to other community spaces amidst their breaks and if they would want to enjoy a certain peace, the rear of a coffeeshop where no one walks is a good place to set up a space. The visibility of the space allows the users a short getaway from the bustle in front of them, while keeping them close enough to react to any duties they need to attend. It is also worth noting that AK-O-01 has a mini garden that is probably tended to by the staff, as a community garden set up by the state can be found barely 10 metres away from this space. As community gardens often have exclusive access, this space tends to allow the staff, who would not be residents, to have a space of their own. There are other spaces that too follow such trends, being close to amenities but in locations where it would not be most favourable for development in theory.

Extending beyond the provision of additional flexibility in sitting or people-watching activities as well as increasing load of the space, their modifications are reactive to the environment that they are set within. The people-generated space of BD_O_06 is formed around a tree which has no prior state provided elements. The evolution of functions within the space can be seen with the potted garden that has grown within it, equipment storage that serve both stewardship of the garden and the tree as well as multiple chairs just for seating. Nearby HDB blocks house provision shops and a hardware store, and this space creates a sense of activity that is not unlike the amenities found in close proximity. (Insert a map of surrounding vicinity and this space) Figure 6.7: AK_V_05, an advanced people-generated space that creates a living space at a void deck, full a range of electrical appliances for multiple conveniences AK_V_05 is an interesting relocated space. Initially, due to a construction hoarding nearby, it was not clear what this space entailed. Upon further investigation through Google Street View, the makeshift store was constructed to house the items from the ongoing renovation of the senior citizens corner. The layout of the relocated furniture, which have been provided by residents, resembles that of a gathering space, with lighting provided for reading as if it were in a normal HDB unit. While unique that it has electrical power sources, due to the relocation, resident’s choosing which furniture and appliances to leave in the open is an impression for the activities that take place in this space. A cross-trainer exercise machine can be found in the corner, with natural draft coming in from that direction. The heterogeneity of elements within this space speaks about the contributions of the residents into developing this living space or even the previous senior citizen corner; diverse yet centralised on comfort to their preference.
