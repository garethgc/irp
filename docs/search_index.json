["hougang.html", "3 Hougang 3.1 Journey through Hougang", " 3 Hougang The first neighbourhood for fieldwork, it comprises of a traditionally Teochew Community in the North East. Where it was home to an agricultural lifestyle in the past, it housed relocated residents from those lands during the era of urban development of Singapore. Seen as one of the older estates, the HDB landscape has been retrofitted and upgraded over the years, including the community spaces both indoors and outdoors. A nuance of Hougang is that it has a reputation of being an Opposition stronghold in terms of politics in Singapore. Due to the nature of politics in Singapore, there has been an unproven impression that Hougang would lack the amenities of politically incumbent estates. Throughout the walks across the neighbourhood, starting from the HDB estates along the Serangoon river (north-east), various different forms of community spaces could be seen. Importantly, community gardens along the North East stretch of Hougang were found to be less exclusive in terms of security and accessibility. While community gardens are not indicated in the mapping of people-generated spaces, they pre-empt an impression of the forms of spaces that could be present in this neighbourhood. The sub sections below will narrate the routes taken across the neighbourhood of Hougang. In total, it took 6 separate days, due to limitations of accessibility and the physicality of not being able to rest. 3.1 Journey through Hougang The cataloging route started from the confluence of Upper Serangoon Road and Hougang Ave 7 towards the north-east side of Hougang. As these areas housed mostly older generation of HDB blocks, there were more instances of community gardens that were makeshift and people-generated. However, they were not devoid of upgrades, as the sheltered paths could be seen through the blocks and parks found in this vicinity. There were a mix of new HDB blocks, recently built during the past 5 years as well as condominiums. The route would eventually lead south, cutting across Tampines Road into Hougang Ave 1, Lorong Ah Soo and Defu. The blocks along Hougang St 22 were newer in contrast to the previous vicinity, and it showed more state-provided community spaces. People-generated spaces found here were mostly found along low HDB blocks with first floor units, often developing the front area of their homes with gardens and sitting areas. Whether these spaces were accessible to all, it is unknown. Closer to the Hainanese Food Market, there were more state-provided community spaces. Interestingly, additional elements have been added to these spaces, giving them a more personalised feel. There are seven people-generated spaces found within Hougang, four outdoor spaces and three spaces found in void decks. Outdoor spaces are defined as spaecs beyond the boundaries of a HDB block and can be comprised of both sheltered and non-sheltered locations. There were many forms of gardens observed in Hougang, each with its own variety. However, the creation of these spaces are ambiguous; it is not clear if they are initiated by state instruments or the communities themselves. Hence, more conversations with residents of the gardens are needed to develop a clearer understanding on how they fit within the realm of people-generated spaces. Figure 3.1: (Left) HG-V-19 - Corner of the void deck space, where residents have added a small storage area for materials of a nearby garden, with movable furniture. (Right) HG-V-20 - Well-furnished space in a void deck near a bus stop, with a mix of elements in furniture and the presence of Chinese decorations and religious ornaments HG-V-19 - Hiding in a corner HG-V-20 - Culturally standing out This space is found at the edge of the void deck and is reasonably hard to spot. Along with two benches provided by the state, an additional chair and foldable table are present, fitting in nicely at the corner. A locked storage compartment which as well as plastic drawers can be found in the space. While what is being stored is unknown, it could have a link with a small garden found adjacent to it that seems to also be people-generated. There are no cameras in this vicinity and its relatively secluded nature gives an impression that the community that uses this space would be rather small and quiet. The space is found at a void deck that is relatively close to a bus stop and a lift landing. While there is a table provided by the state, additional stone tables and benches are to found further from the lift landing. This could give the impression that the original space could not house the larger user capacity without blocking the path to the lift landing. Stacks of plastic chairs as well as stools can be found at the pillars of the space, with Chinese decorations on the walls and a small religious altar present. A small tin container can be seen as an ash tray for smokers. Pails and other types of equipment are stored behind the pillars to service the small plants that are grown towards the carpark at the back of the space, with Chinese decorations on them. This space does not have a camera but the provision of exercise equipment by the state, which looks rather new, would indicate that this space is accepted and known to exist for the residents. Due to its connectivity, people-watching would be a prominent activity, with its higher elevation and a good vantage point.

(Right) HG-O-5 - A resident with a first floor table set up with chairs towards the back along a sheltered walkway HG-O-14 - Viewing the small garden HG-O-5 - Backend of a home A small outdoor space behind a first floor unit. As it is situated beside a walkway connecting HDB blocks together, a likely activity that happens here would be people watching, without being as exposed as placing the space in the front of the block where it lies along the main road. Also, due to its secluded nature, this space is most likely enjoyed by the resident who lives at the unit just beside it, hence it may not be a full community space for all. There are no cameras here. This space is situated near a first floor unit in the void deck. Consisting of two benches, it is a simple space. It is noticeably close to a small potted garden and provides a few of the surrounding area, while being relatively hidden itself. Whether it is a space that other residents can enjoy is not known. There are no cameras in this vicinity. Figure 3.3: HG-V-24 - Wooden seating and cabinets placed outside the state-provided community space and closer to a minimart.

HG-V-24 - A quiet extension of a shop This space is found sandwiched between a minimart and a state-provided community space in a void deck. Wooden seating and cabinets can be found in the space, with a small cabinet housing a religious ornament on top. Additional stackable plastic chairs can be found here as well. While defintely small, it is unique in that residents chose to set up closer to the minimart, rather than just a few metres into the state-provided space. There are no cameras in this section of the space. "]
