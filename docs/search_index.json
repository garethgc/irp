HDB has created spaces for communities to exist through designation of resident corners at void decks, creation of community centres and small-scale food establishments such as void deck ‘coffeeshops’. People-generated spaces have also existed, where residents have initiated their own spatial interventions. These interventions vary from additional furniture such as chairs and small coffee tables to build in cabinets and fridges, creating an environment of coziness that residents could enjoy. These people-generated spaces exhort a sense of community, with residents coming together and interacting in these spaces, along with their contributions to the space. Members who use these spaces may not necessarily be residents living in close proximity. As with community developed spaces, there is the possibility of the creation of community spaces and by extension, people-generated spaces, through a common interest (Jacobs ,1961). It is worth exploring the spatial patterns of people-generated spaces in relation to state-provided community spaces which could offer insights on the interests of residents in creating these spaces. Importantly, through the understanding of possible drivers of the creation of the people-generated spaces, this could highlight possible needs of residents with respect to community living that may be hidden from state designers and planners.

["overview.html", "2 Overview 2.1 3 Neighbourhoods", " 2 Overview 2.1 3 Neighbourhoods Neighborhoods that are shortlisted for study will be mature HDB estates, developed between the 1960s and the 1970s, as well as estates that hold a large population. Three neighborhoods, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok will be chosen for observation. They are chosen not only for their development period, but they also carry a large populace of 180,000 and above while having shared boundaries (City Population, n.d.). Maturity is an important element as it enables better understanding of the interactions and processes in the spaces which may have changed across time while a large living demography enables a better capture and representation for other neighborhoods. As the three mature neighborhoods are found in close proximity to each other, this allows for the study to observe possible spatial ‘spillovers’, whereby spatial distributions and trends are present between neighborhoods.

Some nuances of the neighbourhood: It has been popularised to be the ‘opposition stronghold’ though it holds multiple political constituencies. However, the term sticks and perpetuates a stereotype of the ‘rebellious’ neighbourhood. "],
