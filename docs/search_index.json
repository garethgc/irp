HDB has created spaces for communities to exist through designation of resident corners at void decks, creation of community centres and small-scale food establishments such as void deck ‘coffeeshops’. People-generated spaces have also existed, where residents have initiated their own spatial interventions. These interventions vary from additional furniture such as chairs and small coffee tables to build in cabinets and fridges, creating an environment of coziness that residents could enjoy. These people-generated spaces exhort a sense of community, with residents coming together and interacting in these spaces, along with their contributions to the space. Members who use these spaces may not necessarily be residents living in close proximity. As with community developed spaces, there is the possibility of the creation of community spaces and by extension, people-generated spaces, through a common interest (Jacobs ,1961). It is worth exploring the spatial patterns of people-generated spaces in relation to state-provided community spaces which could offer insights on the interests of residents in creating these spaces. Importantly, through the understanding of possible drivers of the creation of the people-generated spaces, this could highlight possible needs of residents with respect to community living that may be hidden from state designers and planners.

["overview.html", "2 Overview 2.1 3 Neighbourhoods", " 2 Overview 2.1 3 Neighbourhoods Neighborhoods that are shortlisted for study will be mature HDB estates, developed between the 1960s and the 1970s, as well as estates that hold a large population. Three neighborhoods, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok will be chosen for observation. They are chosen not only for their development period, but they also carry a large populace of 180,000 and above while having shared boundaries (City Population, n.d.). Maturity is an important element as it enables better understanding of the interactions and processes in the spaces which may have changed across time while a large living demography enables a better capture and representation for other neighborhoods. As the three mature neighborhoods are found in close proximity to each other, this allows for the study to observe possible spatial ‘spillovers’, whereby spatial distributions and trends are present between neighborhoods.

["hougang.html", "3 Hougang 3.1 Journey through Hougang", " 3 Hougang The first neighbourhood for fieldwork, it comprises of a traditionally Teochew Community in the North East. Where it was home to an agricultural lifestyle in the past, it housed relocated residents from those lands during the era of urban development of Singapore. Seen as one of the older estates, the HDB landscape has been retrofitted and upgraded over the years, including the community spaces both indoors and outdoors. A nuance of Hougang is that it has a reputation of being an Opposition stronghold in terms of politics in Singapore. Due to the nature of politics in Singapore, there has been an unproven impression that Hougang would lack the amenities of politically incumbent estates. Throughout the walks across the neighbourhood, starting from the HDB estates along the Serangoon river (north-east), various different forms of community spaces could be seen. Importantly, community gardens along the North East stretch of Hougang were found to be less exclusive in terms of security and accessibility. While community gardens are not indicated in the mapping of people-generated spaces, they pre-empt an impression of the forms of spaces that could be present in this neighbourhood. The sub sections below will narrate the routes taken across the neighbourhood of Hougang. In total, it took 6 separate days, due to limitations of accessibility and the physicality of not being able to rest. 3.1 Journey through Hougang The cataloging route started from the confluence of Upper Serangoon Road and Hougang Ave 7 towards the north-east side of Hougang. As these areas housed mostly older generation of HDB blocks, there were more instances of community gardens that were makeshift and people-generated (I would most likely highlight areas using separate colours). However, they were not devoid of upgrades, as the sheltered paths could be seen through the blocks and parks found in this vicinity. There were a mix of new HDB blocks, recently built during the past 5 years as well as condominiums. The route would eventually lead south, cutting across Tampines Road into Hougang Ave 1, Lorong Ah Soo and Defu. The blocks along Hougang St 22 were newer in contrast to the previous vicinity, and it showed more state-provided community spaces. People-generated spaces found here were mostly found along low HDB blocks with first floor units, often developing the front area of their homes with gardens and sitting areas. Whether these spaces were accessible to all, it is unknown. Closer to the Hainanese Food Market, there were more state-provided community spaces. Interestingly, additional elements have been added to these spaces, giving them a more personalised feel. There are seven people-generated spaces found within Hougang, specifically towards outdoor and void deck spaces.
