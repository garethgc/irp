<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Ang Mo Kio</h1>
<p>Ang Mo Kio is the youngest among the three neighbourhoods explored in this project but it has a variety of HDB estates throughout. Interestingly, Ang Mo Kio has been experiencing high valuation of its housing developments in recent years which could be due to the good amount of neighbourhood upgrading such as bicycle pathways. As compared to the neighbourhoods of Hougang and Bedok, it has a relatively higher proportion of private housing in its estate and good access to parks. These amenities have given Ang Mo Kio residents a good connection to a variety of lifestyles.</p>
<div id="journey-through-ang-mo-kio" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Journey through Ang Mo Kio</h2>
<p>Starting from the eastern portion of Ang Mo Kio, which is the Cheng San and Teck Ghee HDB estates, there are interesting types of spaces, both state-provided and people-generated. The HDB developments in these areas are relatively older, with only one section near the highway interchange being newly developed. As such, amenities such as coffeeshops, resident corners and elderly care centres are distributed quite evenly. That being said, people-generated spaces found here are in a more personalised nature, with even signs of working activity taking place in these spaces (work table rather than dining tables and washing points with equipment). There is also a certain lull in these spaces, with the setups tending towards longer occupation within the spaces.</p>
<p>Towards the central and western portions of Ang Mo Kio provides more nuanced spaces, with back corners showing more privacy, seating placement facing towards roads and walkways encouraging people-watching and an advanced space resembling a shared living room in the middle of the void deck. The northern portions of Ang Mo Kio has a different elevation and hence, different style of HDB estates and layouts. The Kebun Baru and Yio Chu Kang areas are relatively simple, with only one significant people-generated space near a garden. Gardens are prominent in this area as with the different elevations, it provided for nice corners of getaways for residents.

This void deck space is easily missed due to the placement of pillars throughout the space and an awkward presence of state-provided benches that accompany each pillar. Stacked plastic chairs can be seen chained to one of these benches, where an elderly man sits. A folded table top is found in the corner of one of the pillars. Personal items are placed on a stack of plastic chairs at a nearby washing point. The layout is uncertain, since the chairs remained stacked, but the location is overlooking a nearby carpark, while also near the town centre. It seems to have a decent traffic of non-users, as it is near a mailbox and a lift landing. There are no cameras overlooking the space.

<td style="text-align:center;min-width: 10cm; background-color: #F2E2BC !important;text-align: justify;">
A void deck seating area that is situated near the sheltered walkway between HDB blocks and the nearby bus stop. While there is state provision of the fixed red furniture and metal benches, additional seats can be found filling the gap along a wall. Also, there is a small drawer cabinet hosting plastic items with water bottles found nearby. While the purpose of the bottles is unclear, these items are not locked or secured. Yet, it seems to be relatively safe. A camera provided by the state is present but it seems unlikely to be provided as security for these items and rather more towards the space serving as an entrance to the sheltered paths. Interestingly, the adjacent void deck space has folded tables as well as a signage on a limit on the quantity of tables to be used. This could be indicative of state-support for this space.

This space is rather unique; it has a makeshift store found beside it. It is interesting to find a store that seems to be under the care of residents. This space is also without any state-provided furniture, essentially providing a new sitting space in a void. Tables that look more like household dining tables rather than sitting tables and homely wooden chairs gives it heterogeneous design. Stacks of plastic chairs can be found organized nicely against a wall. The presence of fridges and freezes allows the space to provide beverages or food. Along with fans and an exercise machine, it creates the impression of a living space. It is populated by residents during the trips, both in the late morning and late afternoon. There are no cameras in this space but the provision of power in a void deck (normally not possible) would indicate that the authorities know such a space exists.

This space in the void deck consists of additional seats, with wooden chairs being the primary aesthetic and stacked in the corner. It is a confluence of multiple covered walkways, linking an adjacent coffeeshop with a pedestrian crossing towards another coffeeshop. Hence, this space sees much traffic as well. While there are metal benches provided by the state, the orientation of furniture that are set up by residents faces the view of the pedestrian crossing, being in an elevated position. It can be deduced this space is mostly used for people-watching. In fact, there was an elderly woman sitting in such a position. There are no cameras in this vicinity.

A table tennis table that was provided by the state, some wooden chairs have been added to the space. They are placed beneath the table, in a manner that creates an impression of hiding, which could postulate that they may not exactly be accepted. However, it is a simple layout, and it could indicate the table tennis either being highly used, with the chairs as waiting seats, or the table is being used for other activities than the sport. There are no cameras in this vicinity.

A space with a variation of furniture, mostly tables and chairs. A rocking chair can be seen placed facing the nearby road, which serves the back end of block of shops. People watching could be a prominent activity here, as it has a good vantage view of activities. A table with locked drawers can be found as well, which could indicate this space could encourage some form of handiwork. Other people-generated furniture can be seen haphazardly stored in a corner, with trolleys. The area is also decorated with various Chinese ornaments and decorations from the ceiling and walls, giving the impression that a Chinese-dominant demographic inhabits such a space. There are no cameras in this vicinity.

A very small space, set up near the utility room of the HDB block. Importanly, it is not visible at most angles, which could probably facilitate its hidden nature and possibility, the lack of state knowledge. There are additional seating provided, along with a mirror and an ash tray. This gives the impression that this area is a resting space for workers that have to maintain these rooms, with shelter for hot and wet weather as well as the mirror for facial maintenance.

<td style="text-align:center;min-width: 10cm; background-color: #F2E2BC !important;text-align: justify;">
An outdoor space found just behind a coffeeshop. Non-sheltered, users have set up chairs, placed behind the pots and plants. Clearly people-generated, there is no demarcation of the space. Looking at the proximity to the coffeeshop, it is more than likely setup by the staff of the coffeeshop rather than a larger community initiative. All the furniture are heterogeneous, and there is a possibility it is also used as a smoking corner, with visibility being minimal. There are no cameras by the state of the users in the space.

An outdoor space found adjacent to a coffeeshop and an outdoor carpark that is dominated by large vehicles. Multiple wooden benches are stacked haphazardly in the corner, an indication of times when these could be laid out for more informal gatherings, adding on to the existing chairs at the perimeter of the space. As they were not laid out, it is unsure how the layout is however, it could be a gathering space for truck or bus drivers to have a smoke before or after work. There are no cameras in this vicinity.

While it is under a state-provided shelter, it is considered to be an outdoor space. Additional chairs have been provided in this space, which is at the junction of a sheltered walkway and the path to the bus stop and pedestrian crossing. Also, a dustbin has been provided there. Whilst most likely not for smoking, due to the nature of it being plastic, it gives the impression of a place of ‘stay’. Two of the users of the space had gone to see a small community garden just a few metres away, with another fellow member tending to the garden. This could be a regular activity for them, since the seats do provide a vantage view of the garden and the crossings for people-watching. No cameras on site.
